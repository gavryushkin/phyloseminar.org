% Proposal for SSB funding of phyloseminar.org

I started phyloseminar.org in 2009 with three goals:

* *provide an international forum for the discussion of phylogenetics methodology* to complement that happening at existing meetings
* *disseminate information on phylogenetic best practice* by having seminars freely viewable by the public
* *reduce our carbon footprint* by meeting online rather than in person.

Since that time we have had 31 speakers organized on sessions focused on a wide variety of topics covering methods and applications.
We have had a wide range of speakers from doctoral students to well known researchers such as Joe Felsenstein, John Huelsenbeck and Norman Pace.

The reception to phyloseminar has been excellent.
Over 400 individuals keep up with announcements on Twitter, RSS, and the mailing list.
Meetings are well attended, and the recordings are popular: in 16 month period from December 2011 to March 2013, the recordings were watched 2,576 times from all over the world.

Thus far I have funded phyloseminar out of my own pocket and through research startup funding at my institution.
My startup funding is ending soon.
The videoconferencing service we use has transitioned to a pay service costing $5,000 per year.
Thus far I have spent a lot of my personal time in developing the website, organizing seminars, and troubleshooting A/V issues.
I would like to shift this work over to a programmer in my group, who could also do some much-needed work to improve the website.

I am grateful that the Society of Systematic Biologists has featured phyloseminar on the systbiol.org website and hope for more interaction in the future.
I would welcome an active role of the Society in planning seminar themes and deciding on speakers.
I am also looking for some one-time funding to convert the seminars to a format that can be uploaded to a public video hosting site such as YouTube or Vimeo, as well as updating the website.
Now would be an excellent time for the Society to get involved financially to ensure that this program continues into the future.

As detailed below, I am requesting 37 hours of programmer time as a one-time cost to do some structural improvements and make the recordings more easily available.
After that, I am requesting 12.25 hours per year of help to run the seminar.
I think that these numbers are reasonable, and would be happy to discuss them with you.
