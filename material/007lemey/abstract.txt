Emerging infectious diseases continue to appear all over the world, and
importantly, they have also risen significantly over time after. Having the
potential to quickly adapt to new hosts and environments, RNA viruses are
prime candidates to emerge as global threats to human health. Their rapid
rate of evolution, however, also turns viral genomes into valuable resources
to reconstruct the spatial and temporal processes that are shaping epidemic
or endemic dynamics.

In this seminar, I will highlight recent developments in phylogenetic
diffusion models that tie together sequence evolution and geographic history
in a coherent statistical framework. Both discrete and continuous
phylogeographic models have recently been implemented in a Bayesian
statistical approach. I will position this approach among other popular
phylogeographic methods, and then focus on applications in viral molecular
epidemiology to demonstrate their use. Finally, I will hint at future
extensions that may provide entirely new opportunities for phylogeographic
hypothesis testing.
