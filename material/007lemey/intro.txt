 
Hello everyone and welcome to phyloseminar.org. 
This is the seventh seminar, and the second in our series on phylogenetics and infectious disease.
As I have said before, it would be great if a lab group would volunteer to be the designated audience, and if that could be you please let me know. 
Right now, I am the default audience, and I'm sure that you are all bored of watching me.
 
Let me remind you that if you have a question during the talk, please type it into the message box and I will read it to the speaker, or let me know that you would like for me to turn on your audio.
 
We are very lucky to have Philippe Lemey speaking today.
Philippe got his masters in pharmaceutical sciences, then a masters in bioinformatics, then his PhD in medical sciences, all at the University of Leuven.
He has already written 67 referreed papers, edited a phylogenetic handbook, and if you are interested in the phylogenetics of infectious disease you are no doubt already aware of his work.
His talk today is entitled "Phylogenetic diffusion models and their applications in viral epidemiology"
