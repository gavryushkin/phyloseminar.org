 
Hello everyone and welcome to phyloseminar.org. 
This is the eighth seminar, and the third in our series on phylogenetics and infectious disease.
Our next speaker is Sergei Kosakovsky Pond on October 28th at 9h PDT.

Let me remind you that if you have a question during the talk, please type it into the message box and I will read it to the speaker, or let me know that you would like for me to turn on your audio.
 
We are very lucky to have Marco Salemi speaking to us today.
Marco is well known for his work in molecular epidemiology, intra-host virus evolution, and the application of phylogenetic and population genetic methods to the study of human and simian pathogenic viruses. 
He was a Marie-Curie fellow at the Rega Institute of the Catholic University of Leuven for his Ph.D., did post-doctoral work with Walter M. Fitch at UC Irvine, and is currently at the University of Florida.
His talk today is entitled "Phylogenetic challenges in the retroviridae branch of the tree of life."
