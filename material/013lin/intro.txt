Today, we are very excited to have Mike Lin speaking on phyloseminar.
This is the first talk in a series on evolutionary genomics.
The next talk in this series will be Adam Siepel speaking on May 24th at
11am pst.  He will be presenting his fascinating work on Bayesian
inference of ancient human demography.

We encourage questions during the talk, if you have one you can do one
of two things. First you can just type your question into the meeting
message box. Alternatively, you can type there that you have a question.
In that case I will stop the speaker and turn on your microphone. If you
decide to do that, then please make sure your audio is debugged before
hand, and that you are using some system which will not give us an echo,
such as headphones.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Mike Lin.
I actually know Mike because we both use
the excellent but somewhat obscure programming language OCaml. I posted
a question on the OCaml list that made it clear that I was using OCaml for
phylogenetics, and got this response back from him that was something
like "really??" because he was doing the same.
Looking into his work, I noticed that he was doing awesome work using
codon models to find genes and other interesting genomic features.
So I thought I would invite him to speak in this seminar.
Mike is a graduate student at MIT in Manolis Kellis' lab.
