Hello everyone.
I hope most of the audience of phyloseminar is aware that the models that are most commonly used in phylogenetic inference are significantly oversimplified.
In particular, it is common in practice to make the assumption that sites evolve independently and according to identical processes.
This, of course, is nonsense.
The reason why it is so common is that it makes computation quite simple-- that is, the likelihood function is just a product of easily computed terms.
In the next three talks, we will hear from three courageous souls who are trying to make more sophisticated computation feasible.
The talk today will be from Oscar Westesson, and then we will have Alex Bouchard Cote on October 18, and then Nicolas Rodrigue on November 10th.

We encourage questions during the talk, if you have one you can do one
of two things. First you can just type your question into the meeting
message box. Alternatively, you can type there that you have a question.
In that case I will stop the speaker and turn on your microphone. If you
decide to do that, then please make sure your audio is debugged before
hand, and that you are using some system which will not give us an echo,
such as headphones.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Oscar Westesson.
Oscar's work first caught my eye when he and his advisor Ian Holmes developed a phylo-HMM for recombination detecting using structural-EM for the tree reconstruction.
More recently, my mind was blown by his very dense 36 page manuscript describing in mathematical terms what he will be talking about today.
I'm very happy to have him speaking today, and his talk is entitled "Accurate reconstruction of insertion-deletion histories by statistical phylogenetics".
