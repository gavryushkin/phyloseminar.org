phytools is a new multifunctional phylogenetics package for the R
statistical computing environment. The focus of the package is on
methods for phylogenetic comparative biology; however it also includes
tools for simulation, phylogeny input/output, manipulation, and even
inference. The phytools library is designed for maximum interoperability
with other important R phylogenetics packages such as ape, geiger, and
phangorn.

phangorn is a package for phylogenetic reconstruction and analysis in
the R language. Previously it was only possible to estimate phylogenetic
trees with distance methods in R. phangorn, now offers the possibility
of reconstructing phylogenies with distance based methods, maximum
parsimony or maximum likelihood (ML) and performing Hadamard
conjugation. Extending the general ML framework, this package provides
the possibility of estimating mixture and partition models. Furthermore,
phangorn offers several functions for comparing trees, phylogenetic
models or splits, simulating character data and performing congruence
analyses.
