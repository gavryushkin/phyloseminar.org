Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.
We are now in a session of three talks demonstrating phylogenetics software.
Today, we will hear about R tools for phylogenetic analysis from Liam Revell and Klaus Schliep, then on January 25th Sergei Kosakovsky Pond will give a talk on HyPhy, and Sebastien Hohna and John Huelsenbeck will talk about RevBayes in February.
I'm pretty excited about this session, and I hope you are too.

We encourage questions during the talk, if you have one you can do one
of two things. First you can just type your question into the meeting
message box. Alternatively, you can type there that you have a question.
In that case I will stop the speaker and turn on your microphone.


As I mentioned, today's speakers are Liam Revell, demonstrating about his package phytools, and Klaus Schliep, demonstrating his package phangorn.
Liam is an assistant professor in the department of biology at UMass Boston.
He got his Ph.D. from Harvard in 2009 advised by Jonathan Losos, followed by a postdoc at NESCENT.

Klaus is currently looking for a job. His PhD advisors were Mike Hendy,
Barbara Holland David Penny and Peter Waddell, and he just finished a
postdoc in Paris with Philippe Lopez and Eric Bapteste.

I'm very happy to have them speaking today.
