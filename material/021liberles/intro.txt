Hello everyone.
This is the first talk in a three-part series of talks describing biophysical aspects of molecular evolution.
Today we are going to be hearing from David Liberles, then Richard Goldstein in April, and finally David Pollock in May.

We encourage questions during the talk, if you have one you can do one
of two things. First you can just type your question into the meeting
message box. Alternatively, you can type there that you have a question.
In that case I will stop the speaker and turn on your microphone.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is David Liberles.
He did his Ph.D. in the Dervan group at Caltech working on nucleic acid chemistry.
Then, doing a postdoc in the Benner group, he shifted his focus to computational methods while bringing that wealth of chemistry experience with him.
Since then he has worked on a variety of topics in molecular evolution, including work on adaptive evolution, gene-tree species-tree reconciliation, and of course biophysical aspects of sequence evolution.
