Hello everyone.
This is the second talk in a three-part series of talks describing biophysical aspects of molecular evolution.
Last month we heard from David Liberles, today we will hear from Richard Goldstein, and David Pollock will be speaking in May.

We encourage questions during the talk, if you have a question please go ahead and type your question into the meeting message box.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Richard Goldstein.
Dr. Goldstein's background is in biophysics.
He has brought this perspective to evolutionary studies, and has been one of the leading figures combining protein structure considerations with molecular evolution.
More recently, he has done some very nice work concerning selection, in particular in the influenza virus.
He was at Michigan for quite a while, then to Italy and now he is a researcher at the National Institute for Medical Research in London.
