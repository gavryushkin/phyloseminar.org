Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

This is the first talk in a three-part series of talks on rates and
dates. Our first speaker will be Tanja Gernhard today, then Dan Rabosky
in late October and Helene Morlon in early December. Note that the dates
for those latter talks are going to shift around a bit.

We encourage questions during the talk, if you have a question please go
ahead and type your question into the meeting message box.

I've known Tanja since 2006, when she was doing her diplom with Mike Steel in Christchurch, NZ.
She continued to work there with Mike for her PhD, along with her official PhD advisor, Anusch Taraz, TU München, Germany
2007: Visiting researcher at the Biomathematics Research Institute Christchurch, New Zealand
2008-2011: PostDoc with Prof. Sebastian Bonhoeffer, ETH Zürich, Switzerland
2011-now: Junior group leader (SNF-Ambizione Fellow), ETH Zürich, Switzerland
She has done all sorts of interesting work concerning sochastic processes and phylogenetics, and we're quite lucky to have her here today.
Her talk today is entitled "Inferring macroevolutionary processes based on phylogenetic trees".
