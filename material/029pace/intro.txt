Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The next three talks will be in honor of the late Carl Woese, who as I'm sure
everyone here knows, revolutionized our understanding of the microbial world
via molecular phylogenetics. There may be no better person in the world to
introduce his research accomplishments to us than Norm Pace, who will be
speaking to us today. Following Dr. Pace, Ed DeLong will speak on May 15th
concerning Woese' contributions to microbial ecology, and Phil Hugenholz will
speak in June.

Dr. Pace had published 267 papers between 1960 and 2010, and he continues to
publish at a prodigious rate. His work originally concerned the molecular
biology of ribosomal RNA; this led naturally to performing sequencing on these
molecules. Comparing these sequences led to significant changes in our
understanding of the tree of life. He has also been a leader in bringing this
new understanding to the classroom.

Dr. Pace has recieved a great amount of recognition for his work, including
becoming a member of the national academy in 1991 and a MacArthur award.

We encourage questions during the talk. If you have a question please go ahead
and type your question into the meeting message box and I will read it aloud.
