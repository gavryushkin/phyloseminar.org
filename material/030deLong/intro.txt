Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

We are in the middle of a series of three talks honoring the late Carl Woese,
who revolutionized our understanding of the microbial world via molecular
phylogenetics. Our first talk was from Norm Pace, who told some remarkable
stories about the early days and reminded us to not use the "p" word. Today Ed
DeLong will speak on May 15th concerning Woese' contributions to microbial
ecology. Phil Hugenholz will speak on June 28th.

We are exceedingly lucky to have Ed DeLong speaking to us today. If you watched
Dr. Pace's talk you noticed that Ed was there from the beginning of the use of
sequencing and phylogenetics in microbial ecology. From a methods perspective
he greatly advanced culture-free techniques for identification of microbes,
including the development of "phylogenetic dyes" to identify organisms by their
16s under a microscope. His work has also fundamentally changed our
understanding of microbial life in the oceans. His most famous such work was
the year 2000 discovery of the bacteriorhodopsins, a family of genes found in
microbes that are similar to those enabling us to see light. These genes are
used by the microbes to get energy from light in an alternative pathway to that
of chlorophyll. He has used phylogenetics throughout his work.

Dr. Pace has recieved a great amount of recognition for his work, including
being elected a member of the national academy in 2008.

We encourage questions during the talk. If you have a question please go ahead
and type your question into the meeting message box and I will read it aloud.
