Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

Today is the last talk of a series of three talks honoring the late Carl Woese,
who revolutionized our understanding of the microbial world via molecular
phylogenetics. Our first talk was from Norm Pace, then Ed DeLong, and today we
have Phil Hugenholtz.

We are exceedingly lucky to have Phil Hugenholtz speaking today, another one of
the Norm Pace diaspora. He has published widely on microbial genomics as well
as on methods to learn from genomes, and has a remarkable amount of expertise
in the microbiology of wastewater treatment plants. He is well known for what
has been known first as the Hugenholtz taxonomy, and is now known as the
GreenGenes taxonomy, which continues to evolve using relationships inferred
from genetic data. In this way he is propogating the conceptual framework
started by Woese.

On a personal note...

We encourage questions during the talk. If you have a question please go ahead
and type your question into the meeting message box and I will read it aloud.
