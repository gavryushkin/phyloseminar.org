Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, which is supported by the Society of Systematic Biologists.

Today is the first talk of a series of two talks on a project that I think of being obvious and impossible at the same time.
The idea is to aggregate all of the knowledge that we have about individual groups of organisms from the distinct trees that people are generating into one overall tree.
This project is called the Open Tree of Life.
We will have two talks from people working on the Open Tree of Life, first from Karen Cranston today and then next from Stephen Smith in one week.

When I think about Karen I think about her excellent work on big data projects, but she started off doing research on both applied and theoretical aspects of phylogenetics.
She did her PhD at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, under the direction of Bruce Rannala, and developed some interesting ideas concerning summarizing tree posteriors and gene-tree species-tree reconciliation.

Since then Karen has been a part of every neat big data project in phylogenetics that I am aware of.
This includes the encyclopaedia of life, iPlant, dryad, and the open tree of life.
She is a staunch open access and open data advocate, and is currently a bioinformaticist at NESCENT.

Welcome, Karen, to phyloseminar, and I'm looking forward to your talk.
