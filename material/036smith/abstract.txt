The emergence of graph databases has presented a potential alternative for ways of storing and querying phylogenetic trees. The Open Tree of Life has been exploring these options and ways that trees from multiple datasets or within a single dataset can be placed in a graph database. I will go over some of the ways that we do this and how we can query and synthesize trees as an alternative to supertrees and consensus trees. While still a work in progress, these methods show great promise for further development.
