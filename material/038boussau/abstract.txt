In this second talk of our series on genome-scale phylogeny, I build upon Gergely's introduction and present the modelling assumptions and algorithmic details behind some of the methods we and others have developed. There will be two parts to this talk.
I start with the model of gene duplications and losses implemented in PHYLDOG. I present the assumptions we make and the shortcuts we take to improve the program's efficiency, and show some results on real and simulated sequence data. I notably show problems that arise when the program is confronted with data generated with a model of incomplete lineage sorting (Rasmussen and Kellis, 2012), and present avenues of research to find solutions to these problems.
In the second part, I present our current efforts to use our model of gene duplication, loss, and transfer (Sz√∂llosi et al, 2013) to infer a species tree in which speciation nodes are ordered in time. I briefly remind the forgetful viewer of what this model does and how it works, and I then explain how we devise a new MCMC algorithm to use it on data sets containing dozens of species and thousands of gene families.
I finish with some perspectives of our plans uniting gene tree-species tree models and databases of gene families and phylogenetic trees.
