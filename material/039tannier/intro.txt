Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the Society of Systematic Biologists.

Today is the third talk in a mini-course of three talks on genome-scale phylogeny.
First we heard from Gergely Szollosi and Bastien Boussau, and today from Eric Tannier.

Eric has a long term interest in problems relating to the evolution of genome organization.
He came from a computer science angle by considering the problem of sorting by reversals.
After writing quite a few important papers on that subject from a technical viewpoint, he began investigating the biological implications of this work.
He has also done important work on incorporating genome rearrangements into phylogenetic inference.
Most recently he has been collaborating with the other two speakers of this mini-course on large scale gene-tree species-tree inference.
Thanks for speaking, Eric, and I'm looking forward to your talk.
