Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the
Society of Systematic Biologists.

Today is the first talk in a series of two talks on phylogenetic approaches to
cancer. Today we will hear from Kamila Naxerova, and second we will have Roland
Schwarz from Cambridge talking about "phylogenetic quantification of
intra-tumour heterogeneity"

Kamila has been a PhD student and then postdoctoral fellow at Harvard
University and Massachusetts General Hospital since 2009, advised by Rakesh
Jain. The focus of her work there has been on the work she is going to be
talking about today, which is phylogenetic analysis of human primary cancers
and metastases. Before that, she got her master's degree in Heidelberg and has
worked on various projects at the intersection of informatics and cancer,
including looking for prognostic gene expression signatures in breast cancer,
and performing a molecular characterization of lymphoma cell lines. Thanks for
speaking, Kamila, and I'm looking forward to your talk.
