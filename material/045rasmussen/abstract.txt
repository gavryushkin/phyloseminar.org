The fields of phylogenetics and population genetics share several
important models including gene trees, species trees, ancestral
recombination graphs (ARGs), and pedigrees. These models are all
closely related and can be viewed as subgraphs of one another. Amongst
them, the ARG is particularly central and if inferred efficiently can
enable many applications such as inference of selection and
demography. Here, I will review various helpful mathematical tools for
working with ARGs, including what we call the threading algorithm, the
branch graph, and the leaf trace visualization.
