Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the
Society of Systematic Biologists. Let me remind you that there is a Q&A
feature of hangouts on air, and I encourage you to use it.

Today is the last talk in a series of three talks on ancestral recombination
graphs. First we heard Matt Rasmussen, then we heard from Peter Ralph, and
today we are going to hear from Matthias Steinrucken speaking from his new
position at UMass Amherst.

Matthias got his Diplom from Bielefeld University working with Ellen Baake
working on recombination dynamics with selection, then his PhD at TU Berlin
with Jochen Blath working on multiple merger coalescents. He then did a postdoc
with Yun Song at UC Berkeley, mostly working on things related to the
sequentially Markov coalescent, which I think is the subject of his talk today.

Welcome, Matthias, and I'm looking forward to your talk.
