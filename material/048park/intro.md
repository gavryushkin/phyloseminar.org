Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the
Society of Systematic Biologists.

As you are no doubt aware, a little more than a year ago there were a series
of events that led to the current epidemic of Ebola hemhorragic fever. Since
that time, there have been over 26,000 cases and over 10,000 mortalities.
The epidemic still rages in Sierra Leone and Guinea. 

As part of this, the molecular evolution of the Ebola virus has been a subject
of considerable interest by researchers and the general public. 
Today we are lucky to have the first talk 
in a series of two talks by a pair of collaborators, Danny Park and Gytis Dudas, 
who are key parts of a larger team really driving our understanding of 
the transmission routes and the evolutionary trajectory of Ebola. 
Today we are going to hear from Danny Park, who will give an overview of
their recent research in the field.

Danny got his bachelor's and master's degrees are in computer science from MIT, where he developed software tools for in silico protein design in the Keating Lab. He then worked with the Sabeti Lab as a software engineer at the Broad, then as a Harvard graduate student, and finally, as a computational biologist at the Broad. 

Welcome, Danny, and I'm looking forward to your talk.
