 
Hello everyone and welcome to phyloseminar.org. 
This is the fourth seminar, and the second in our series on the gene-tree species-tree problem. 
The next series will be on the crossover between phylogenetics and infectious disease research. 
For one reason or another, the ID folks were hesitant to submit abstracts without a direct invitation, so I just selected some people I think do top-quality research rather than put it to a vote. 
There will be four talks, given by Trevor Bedford, Marco Salemi, Philippe Lemey, and Sergei Kosavosky Pond.
I'm pretty excited about that lineup and I hope you are too.

As I have said before, it would be great if a lab group would volunteer to be the designated audience, and if that could be you please let me know. 
That would mean that you could avoid watching me watch the speaker.  
It's just easier for the speakers if they get at least a little feedback. 
 
Speaking of which, we want to get lots of questions today.
If you have a question, please either type it into the message box, and I will read it to the speaker.
Another option, which is possible if you have already debugged your audio, is to just type "question" into the message box and I will turn on your audio.
 
Our speaker today is Noah Rosenberg, who is an associate professor at the University of Michigan. 
Noah, started out doing a Ph.D. in pure math then got distracted by biology, completing a Ph.D. with xxx.
He then did a postdoc with XXX at the University of Southern California.
Noah's research spans a broad range, from proving theorems about evolutionary models to quite applied data-driven work on the inference of human evolutionary history.
He is going to treat us to a little theory today in his talk entitled "Consistency properties of species tree inference algorithms under the multispecies coalescent."
