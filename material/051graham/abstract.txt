Beta-diversity has long been recognized as an instrumental diversity measure providing insight as to how and why diversity varies across space.  Beta-diversity also underlies most complementarity-based reserve design algorithms which quantify the extent to which an area contributes unrepresented features to an existing area or set of areas.  In the early 2000 researchers started to recognize that beta-diversity could be extended to include phylogenetic information.  By accounting for shared evolutionary history among assemblages/regions phylogenetic beta-diversity can provide insights into both the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms influencing variation in species diversity and the best way to conserve phylogenetic diversity in a reserve system. In this seminar I will begin by briefly reviewing various definitions and approaches to measuring and mapping beta-diversity.  Then I will use a series of examples to show some of the new insights phylogenetic beta-diversity has provided to both basic science and conservation.
