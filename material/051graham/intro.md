Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the
Society of Systematic Biologists.

We are in the middle of three talks about phylogenetic approaches to genetic conservation.
The last talk was from Arne Mooers, today we have Catherine Graham, and next we will have Sandrine Pavoine.
I'm grateful to Arne for helping organize this theme session.

As I mentioned, today we have a talk from Catherine Graham.
Catherine is recognized for her analysis of statistical species distribution models, in particular for presence-only data.
She is also known for her work on genetic conservation, which is what she'll be describing today.
Catherine graduated from the University of Missouri at St. Louis in 2000, and is now Associate Professor of Ecology and Evolution at Stony Brook.
Welcome, Catherine, and I'm looking forward to your talk.
