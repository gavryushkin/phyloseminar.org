Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the
Society of Systematic Biologists.

We are wrapping up a session of three talks about phylogenetic approaches to genetic conservation.
The first talk was from Arne Mooers, then we had Catherine Graham, and today we have Sandrine Pavoine.
I'm grateful to Arne for helping organize this theme session.

As I mentioned, today we have a talk from Sandrine Pavoine.
She works in mathematical ecology and is particularly interested in measures of species, functional and phylogenetic diversity, and their applications to conservation and community ecology.
Sandrine has her Ph.D. in Statistical Ecology from University of Lyon, where she was supervised by Daniel Chessel.
She was then Marie-Curie Fellow working on mathematical ecology in the Oxford Department of Zoology.
She is now an Associate Professor at the National Museum of Natural History, and a Research associate at the Oxford Department of Zoology.
Welcome, Sandrine, and I'm looking forward to your talk.
