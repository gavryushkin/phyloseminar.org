As was recently shown, variation in speciation rates among lineages results in substantial biases when estimating diversification rates from phylogenetic trees. Consequently, confidence in many phylogenetic estimates for trait-dependent models of diversification from trees on extant species alone may well exceed what is possible. From a mathematical point of view a fair amount is known about the probability distribution of ancestral trees derived from single type birth and death process, while much less is known about ancestral trees derived from multi-type branching processes with type dependent rates.  In this talk I will present a few results in this direction. First, there is an algorithmic way to construct an ancestral tree of the standing population of a multi-type branching process in terms of a Markov chain (of vectors of types and multiplicities). This construction allows one to get explicit formulae for calculating: (a) statistical features that describe the shape of the tree (the law of coalescence times together with types on the ancestral lineages), and (b) statistical features that link types in the standing population with the shape of the tree (the law of same-type coalescence times). Second, explicit calculations can be used to compare the effect that different branching mechanisms have on the distributions of ancestral trees. I will illustrate this in a simple example of two-type process with completely asymmetrical vs symmetrical probabilities of offspring types.
