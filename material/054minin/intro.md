Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the
Society of Systematic Biologists.

We are in the middle of three talks on the theme of biased sampling in phylogenetics: what does it do to our inferences and what can we do about it.
We started with a theoretical perspective from probabilist Lea Popovic.
Today's talk is from Vladimir Minin concerning about a new model that explicitly accounts for preferential sampling.
Next talk will be from Nicola de Maio, who will discuss the sensitivity of discrete trait methods to sampling strategy.

As I mentioned, today we have a talk from Vladimir Minin.
After his undergraduate education in Ukraine, Vladimir did a masters in math at the University of Idaho, followed by a masters and a PhD in biomath from UCLA advised by Marc Suchard.
Since 2007 he has been on the faculty of the University of Washington department of statistics, and was promoted in 2013.
Vladimir works on a quite broad range of statistical topics, including but definitely not limited to phylogenetics.
Today he's going to tell us about the impact of biased sampling on changes in effective population size, and what we can do about it.

Welcome, Vladimir, and I'm looking forward to your talk.
