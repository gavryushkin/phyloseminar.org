Computational algorithms to infer phylogenetic relationships or detect sites of positive selection are widely used in diverse branches of biology. However, anyone with a passing knowledge of modern biochemistry can recognize that the quantitative models of the evolutionary process used by these algorithms are woefully oversimplified. I will discuss prospects for making these models more realistic while keeping them computationally tractable. In particular, I will discuss how new sources of high-throughput experimental data can be leveraged to improve algorithms for the analysis of gene sequences.
