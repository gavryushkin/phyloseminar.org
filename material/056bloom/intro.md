Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the
Society of Systematic Biologists.

I think that we all appreciate that protein structure greatly determines the evolutionary trajectory of protein coding genes, though it's rare for people to incorporate structure into molecular evolution studies.
The reason structure is typically not incorporated because it's challenging.
However, some courageous individuals are working to incorporate structural information into molecular evolution studies, and we have three of them for this phyloseminar theme.
This will include Jesse Bloom today, then Claus Wilke April 20th, and Richard Goldstein May 25th.

Q&A app...

As I mentioned, today we have a talk from Jesse Bloom.
Jesse started out in chemistry, getting his B.S. in Biochemistry from the University of Chicago, his MPhil in Theoretical Chemistry at Cambridge, then his Ph.D. in Chemistry at Caltech.
During this process he was progressively moving towards working on the impact mutations have on protein structure and function.
He did his postdoc at Caltech with David Baltimore, where he did landmark work showing that stabilizing mutations are needed in influenza before resistance mutations can develop.
He has continued to do very interesting work here at the Fred Hutch, where he recently made his promotion to Associate Member.
Thanks for participating, Jesse, and I'm looking forward to your talk.
