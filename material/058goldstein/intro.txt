Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the
Society of Systematic Biologists.

For this session we are hearing from three courageous individuals are working to incorporate structural information into molecular evolution studies.
The first talk was from Jesse Bloom, in which he described his work using deep mutational scanning experiments to develop per-site models of amino acid substitution for specific genes.
Then we heard from Claus Wilke, who described using structural information to estimate mutation rates, and today's talk is from Richard Goldstein.
The next set of talks will concern modeling rate heterogeneity in phylogenetics.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Richard Goldstein.
Dr. Goldstein's background is in biophysics.
He has brought this perspective to evolutionary studies, and has been one of the leading figures combining protein structure considerations with molecular evolution.
More recently, he has done some very nice work concerning epistasis.
Richard was on faculty at Michigan for quite a while, then to Italy and now he is a researcher at the National Institute for Medical Research in London.
