I will discuss the history of the use of computers to infer
phylogenies, starting in the late 1950s and giving particular emphasis to
the introduction of the major methods in the 1960s.  Much of this history
I watched happen, from 1965 on.  In particular I will explain the way
that work in biological systematics, in population genetics, and in molecular
evolution of multiple species gave rise to the early methods.  I will touch on
the controversies that developed in the 1970s and 1980s, a period of intense
conflict over what should be the logical foundation of the reconstruction of
phylogenies.  Computational phylogenetics is becoming continually
more statistical and continually less connected to the separable task of
erecting a biological classification of organisms.  Recent Twitter
controversies show that arguments that were dominant and vehement in the 1980s
are now taken seriously by few.
