Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the Society of Systematic Biologists.

For this series of three talks, we are hearing from three individuals who have thought a lot about modeling heterogeneity in the substitution process across sites.
Last time we heard from Andrew Roger, who motivated the need for more advanced models with evidence from deep phylogenetics, and introduced the CAT models.
Today we will hear from Nathan Whelan, who I believe will propose a site-partitioning approach to handle the same issues.
Finally we will hear from Nicholas Lartillot, who will describe Dirichlet process mixture models for site heterogeneity in detail.

I wanted to remind people that the Q&A app is gone now, so you can ask questions through Twitter or IRC, as described in the "attending" section of the phyloseminar website.
If you have a different idea about how we can organize discussions, just email me.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Nathan Whelan.
Nathan did his Ph.D. at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa with Phillip Harris.
After that he did a postdoc with Kenneth Halanych at Auburn University.
He has just recently taken a position in the US Fish and Wildlife Service, where he is the Director of the Southeast Conservation Genetics Lab in Warm Springs, Georgia.

Welcome, Nathan, and thanks for participating.
