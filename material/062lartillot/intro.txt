Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the Society of Systematic Biologists.

For this series of three talks, we are hearing from three individuals who have thought a lot about modeling heterogeneity in the substitution process across sites.
First we heard from Andrew Roger, who motivated the need for more advanced models with evidence from deep phylogenetics, and introduced the CAT models.
Then we heard from Nathan Whelan, who advocated a site-partitioning approach to handle the same issues.
Today we will hear from Nicholas Lartillot, who will describe Dirichlet process mixture models for site heterogeneity in detail.

I wanted to remind people that the Q&A app is gone now, so you can ask questions through Twitter or IRC, as described in the "attending" section of the phyloseminar website.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Nicholas Lartillot.
Nicholas started his education in physics at the ENS in Paris, and started doing biology first doing cloining and sequencing


and then got a PhD in Andre Adoutte's lab working on experimental embryology.
He then went to Herve Philippe's lab at the University of Montreal for a postdoc, then landed a permananent position in Montpellier for four years.
After that he went back to the University of Montreal as an assistant professor, then returned to France, this time to the University of Lyon.
He currently holds the title of CNRS Research Director.

Welcome, Nicholas, and thanks for participating.
