Recombination happens frequently in most bacterial and archaeal species. Traditional phylogenetic techniques do not account for this, which can greatly limit their usefulness for the analysis of genomic data. The coalescent with gene conversion accurately models the ancestry process of prokaryotes, and this can be used to simulate realistic data, but it is too complex to use in an inferential setting. Approximations have therefore been introduced, which are centred around the concept of the clonal genealogy, that is the phylogeny obtained by following the line of ancestry of the recipient of each recombination event. I will review these mathematical models and ongoing efforts to develop statistical software to perform phylogenomic analysis in recombining prokaryotes.
