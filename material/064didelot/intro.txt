Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the Society of Systematic Biologists.

In this series of 3 talks, we are looking at phylogenetic opportunities and challenges from bacteria and archaea.
Our first talk was from Laura Hug about recent discoveries of new groups of organisms, our talk today will be from Xavier Didelot, and next we will be hearing from Tim Vaughan.

I wanted to remind people that the Q&A app is gone now, so you can ask questions through Twitter or IRC, as described in the "attending" section of the phyloseminar website.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Xavier Didelot.
Xavier did a doctorate in Statistical Genetics in the Department of Statistics, University of Oxford.
He then did a postdoc in the Department of Statistics at the University of Warwick.
Then in 2010 he moved back to the University of Oxford as a leadership fellow in genomic microbiology before taking his current appointment with Imperial College London in April 2012.

Welcome, Xavier, and thanks for participating.
