The advent of rapid and inexpensive sequencing technologies has necessitated the development of computationally efficient methods for analyzing sequence data for many genes simultaneously in a phylogenetic framework.  The coalescent process is the most commonly used model for linking the underlying genealogies of individual genes with the global species-level phylogeny, but inference under the coalescent model is computationally daunting in the typical inference frameworks (e.g., the likelihood and Bayesian frameworks) due to the dimensionality of the space of both gene trees and species trees.   By viewing the data arising under the phylogenetic coalescent model as a collection of site patterns, the algebraic structure associated with the probability distribution on the site patterns can be used to develop computationally efficient methods for inference via phylogenetic invariants.

In this talk, I will discuss three problems that can be addressed using invariants. First, I will describe how identifiability results for four-taxon species trees based on site pattern probabilities can be used to build a quartet-based inference algorithm for trees of arbitrary size. Second, methods for rooting phylogenetic species trees inferred under the coalescent model will be discussed. Finally, the use of invariants to detect species that arose via hybridization will be described.  The methods presented will be demonstrated on several phylogenomic-scale datasets.  Because the methods are derived in a fully model-based framework (i.e., the coalescent process is used to model the relationship between gene trees and the species tree, and standard nucleotide substitution models (GTR+I+G and all submodels) are used for sequence-level evolution), these methods are promising approaches for computationally efficient, model-based inference for the large-scale sequence data available today.
