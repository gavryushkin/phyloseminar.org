Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The current theme is phylogenetic invariants, which are polynomial relationships on data generated from a tree.
In this series of 3 talks, we are hearing three perspectives on invariants and how they may used to make inferences.
First we heard from Marta Casanellas Rius who introduced the topic and brought us up to date.
Today we will have Laura Kubatko describe coalescent-based inference using invariants, and
after that Barbara Holland will describe Markov invariants and how they differ from classical phylogenetic invariants.

I wanted to remind people that the Q&A app is gone now, so you can ask questions through Twitter or IRC, as described in the "attending" section of the phyloseminar website.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Laura Kubatko.
Laura has spent much of her career at Ohio State University, starting with her masters in Statistics and then her PhD in Biostatistics.
After graduation she took a position at the University of New Mexico, where she stayed until 2006 until she returned to OSU, where she has been ever since.
Laura has been a full professor since 2013, and has played a leadership role at the Mathematical Bioscience Institute.

Welcome, Laura, and thanks for participating.
