The influenza A virus infects approximately 500 million individuals each year.  Owing to its RNA makeup, influenza mutates extremely rapidly allowing the virus population to escape the pull of the human immune system.  A single individual may be infected year after year by antigenically novel strains.  As result of this rate of mutation, the timescale of  influenza evolution is a human timescale.  We get the chance to observe the process of evolution in action.  However, the rapid pace of evolution also causes an intrinsic link between evolutionary and ecological dynamics in the virus population.  The availability of temporally spaced sequence data allows estimation of details of these dynamics unavailable in other systems.  Through analysis of this data, I address open questions regarding patterns of adaptation and the effects of seasonality in the human influenza virus.
