 
Hello everyone and welcome to phyloseminar.org. 
This is the sixth seminar, and the first in our series on phylogenetics and infectious disease.
I wanted to let people know that Marco Salemi's talk has been postponed, as he couldn't do his original date in May. 
Thus the next talk will be 
Philippe Lemey 		July 16th 
Sergei Kosavosky Pond   August
Marco Salemi    	September 20th

As I have said before, it would be great if a lab group would volunteer to be the designated audience, and if that could be you please let me know. 
That would mean that you could avoid watching me watch the speaker.  
 
Speaking of which, we want to get lots of questions today. If you have a question, please either type it into the message box, and I will read it to the speaker. Another option, which is possible if you have already debugged your audio, is to just type "question" into the message box and I will turn on your audio.
 
Our speaker today is Trevor Bedford. 
Trevor got his PhD under Dan Hartl at Harvard. 
Now he is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Associate doing research in the lab of Mercedes Pascual at the University of Michigan, where he is studying the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamcs of the influenza virus.
Today he will be speaking about his work in a talk entitled "Adaptation and migration in the human influenza virus".
