I will first highlight why network reconstruction is worth the effort, and then explain some of the challenges of network reconstruction and network intepretation. These challenges include identifiability issues, difficulties to summarize network uncertainty, and interpretation issues related to network-thinking. Finally, I will describe new phylogenetic comparative methods that can be applied to phylogenetic networks, and are implemented in the PhyloNetworks Julia package.
