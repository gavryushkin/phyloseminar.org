Historically, quantitative genetics was developed to understand macroscopic phenotypes, such as body mass. However, with the advent of high throughput genomics technology, we now have access to extremely high dimensional molecular phenotypes. One of the most common traits analyzed is gene expression, measured via RNA sequencing in modern applications. I will attempt to put this work in historical context, highlighting some early work on building models of neutral gene expression evolution, which poses unique challenges in a phylogenetic comparative framework. I will also discuss some work, including my own, that attempts to leverage the dimensionality of gene expression data to increase power. Finally, I will conclude with some perspectives on future directions for analysis of molecular phenotypes in a phylogenetic context.
