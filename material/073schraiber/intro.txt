Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The current theme is on phylogenetic models for continuous traits and their applications.
In this series of 3 talks, we are hearing three perspectives on continuous traits.
Today we will hear from Josh Schraiber on applications of phylogenetic continuous trait models to gene expression.
Then in February we will hear from Josf Uyeda on the need for phylogenetic natural history,
And then in March Michael Landis will describe his work on pulsed models for trait evolution.

If you want to ask a question, you can either tweet @phyloseminar or type your question in the "live chat" box to the right of the video on YouTube.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Josh Schraiber.
Josh got his PhD working under Monty Slatkin at UC Berkeley, followed by a postdoc with Josh Akey at University of Washington.
He is now an Assistant Professor in Biology at Temple University.

Welcome, Josh, and thanks for participating.
