This series of 4 talks will be an introduction to phylogenetics in 4 parts from master expositor Paul Lewis.

Part 1 covers terminology used in describing phylogenetic trees and the basic features of substitution models, including a survey of the common GTR family of models as well as codon and amino acid models.
