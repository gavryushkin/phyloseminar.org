Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

This series of 4 talks will be an introduction to phylogenetics in 4 parts from master expositor Paul Lewis.
Paul has developed this material of the course of many years in his teaching at the Woods Hole Molecular Evolution Workshop.
Today's talk will be about basics of phylogenetic trees and models.

If you want to ask a question, you can either tweet @phyloseminar or type your question in the "live chat" box to the right of the video on YouTube.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Paul Lewis, who is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut.
Paul is a leader in Bayesian phylogenetics theory and practice.
Of his many research contributions to phylogenetics, two especially stand out to me personally:
first, his work on model selection and comparison, leading to several new ways of efficiently computing marginal likelihoods,
and second, his seminal work on non-bifurcating tree inference and its importance in getting accurate phylogenies.
Welcome, Paul, and thanks for participating.
