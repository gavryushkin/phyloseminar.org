Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The current theme is the adequacy phylogenetic models.
In this series of 3 talks, we are hearing three perspectives on model adequacy.
Today we will hear from Jeremy Brown on the role of model fit in resolving the tree of life.
Then in November we will hear from Sebastian DuchÃªne on model adequacy in infectious disease phylodynamics.
And then in December Sarah Hilton will describe her work on experimental codon models for influenza phylogenetics.

If you want to ask a question, you can either tweet @phyloseminar or type your question in the "live chat" box to the right of the video on YouTube.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Jeremy Brown.
Jeremy got his PhD working under David Hillis at UT Austin, followed by a postdoc with John Huelsenbeck at UC Berkeley.
Jeremy is now an Associate Professor in Biology at Louisiana State University.

Welcome, Jeremy, and thanks for participating.
