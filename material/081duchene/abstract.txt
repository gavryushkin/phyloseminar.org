Statistical models are widely used in phylogenetics to infer the evolutionary history of groups of organisms. In the context of rapidly evolving pathogens, phylogenetic analyses can be used to make inferences about epidemiological processes, a field known as infectious disease phylodynamics. A key component of phylodynamic analyses is a branching model to describe transmission. For example, coalescent and birth-death models can estimate the average number of secondary infections using phylogenetic trees. However, the resulting inferences are contingent on the extent to which models describe key aspects of the data. For example, the simplest models in phylodynamics assume that transmission rates are constant over time and lineages, which is not necessarily the case for many empirical data sets. In this talk I will discuss model adequacy methods in phylodynamics. In contrast to model selection, where models are ranked according to their statistical fit, the goal of model adequacy is to determine whether key aspects of the data at hand could have been generated by the model in question. That is, to assess the absolute, rather than relative, model fit. Model adequacy typically consists of simulating data from the model and comparing them to the empirical data. The crux of such comparisons is to develop summary statistics that represent the expectation under the model. Using examples from different virus data sets I will present several approaches to assess phylodynamic models to reveal the importance of modelling population dynamics, such as population structure and variation in transmission rates, in epidemiological estimates. Finally, I will illustrate ways in which an uptake of these approaches can improve our understanding of infectious disease evolution and motivate the development of models in phylodynamics.
