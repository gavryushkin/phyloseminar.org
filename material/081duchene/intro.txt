Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The current theme is the adequacy phylogenetic models.
In this series of 3 talks, we are hearing three perspectives on model adequacy.
Last time we heard from Jeremy Brown on the role of model fit in resolving the tree of life.
Today we will hear from Sebastian Duchêne on model adequacy in infectious disease phylodynamics.
And then in December Sarah Hilton will describe her work on experimentally informed site-specific substitution models.

If you want to ask a question, you can either tweet @phyloseminar or type your question in the "live chat" box to the right of the video on YouTube.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Sebastian Duchêne.
Jeremy got his PhD working under Simon Ho at the University of Sidney, followed by a postdoc with Edward Holmes at the Charles Perkins Center at the University of Sidney.
Jeremy is now a McKenzie Postdoctoral Fellow in the Holt lab at the University of Melbourne.

Welcome, Sebastian, and thanks for participating.
