Phylogenetic substitution models are hypotheses about evolutionary process and, like all models, they contain simplifying assumptions. One common assumption is that all sites in a gene evolve identically. However, even a cursory analysis of a multiple sequence alignment will show that this assumption is violated in natural protein evolution. Relaxing this assumption greatly increases the number of model parameters to account for the effect of every amino acid at every site in the protein. We have developed a family of models, called Experimentally Informed Codon Models (ExpCMs), which describe the site-specific constraints on a protein using empirical measurements from a high-throughput functional assay in the lab. Even though the vast majority of the parameters are determined empirically rather than fit to the data, we have found that ExpCMs are generally better descriptors of natural sequence evolution than site-uniform codon models, as evaluated by model comparison techniques such as AIC. Now, we are turning to model adequacy tests as a more quantitative and comprehensive way to evaluate ExpCMs on a site-by-site basis. We believe that sites which are inadequate descriptors of natural sequence evolution may indicate sites where the selective pressure differs between the lab and nature and point to interesting biological mechanisms. Model adequacy tests will also allow us to compare how well experiments performed under different conditions are able to capture natural constraint. Overall, the site-specific ExpCMs can be used as a tool to bridge the gap between what we know about selection in the lab and in nature.
