Hello everyone.
We are in the middle of a three-part series of talks describing the work of young researchers who are extending phylogenetic computation beyond the IID models to which we are accustomed.
A month ago we had a very nice talk from Oscar Westesson, today, we have Alex Bouchard Cote on October 18, and then Nicolas Rodrigue on November 10th.

We encourage questions during the talk, if you have one you can do one
of two things. First you can just type your question into the meeting
message box. Alternatively, you can type there that you have a question.
In that case I will stop the speaker and turn on your microphone.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Alex Bouchard Cote.
I first heard of his work on the Poisson Indel Process through Lior Pachter, who said that it was the most interesting and exciting development in phylogenetics he saw this year.
Alex's PhD advisor was the very well known Berkeley statistician Michael Jordan.
Alex skipped doing a postdoc, and went straight to a faculty position in the highly regarded statistics department at UBC.
I'm very happy to have him speaking today, and his talk is entitled "The poissson indel process."
