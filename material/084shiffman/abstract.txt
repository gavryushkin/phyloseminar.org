Recent advances in single-cell methods have made tangible how individual cell profiles can reflect the imprint of ephemeral or dynamic processes. However, synthesizing this information to reconstruct dynamic biological phenomena – from data that are noisy, heterogenous, and sparse, and from processes that may unfold asynchronously – poses a computational and statistical challenge.

We develop a full generative model and inference for reconstructing a dynamic process (cellular differentiation) from many static snapshots (single-cell RNA-seq profiles), with calibrated uncertainties. Specifically, we define cell state by the latent parameterization of a distribution over gene expression space, and model these latent vectors as arising from bifurcating, self-reinforcing paths along a probabilistic tree — necessitating the design of a new class of Bayesian tree models for data that arise from a latent branching spectrum.

In this talk, I explore how our model fills a hole in the existing literature on probabilistic trees, and what having an explicit generative model buys us in the context of reconstructing trajectories to understand cell fate decisions in differentiation.
