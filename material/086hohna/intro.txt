Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The current theme is branch-specific diversification inference, by which I mean learning about the diversification process via phylogenetics.
If this is macroevolution, then we're talking about speciation and extinction rates, and if this is microevolution, then we're talking about fitness estimation.
Today we will hear from Sebastian Hohna about on his Bayesian approach for estimating branch-specific speciation and extinction rates.
If you want to ask a question, you can either tweet @phyloseminar or type your question in the "live chat" box to the right of the video on YouTube.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Sebiastian Hohna.
Sebastian got his a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at The University of Auckland under the supervision of Alexei Drummond.
Even though this was "only" a masters thesis, it started many important lines of research, including ones we are exploring in my group.
He then continued his work from Stockholm University under the supervision of Tom Britton and Fredrik Ronquist, and then he did a Miller postdoc with John Huelsenbeck and Rasmus Nielsen.
He continued to innovate, leading to a lot of new work on estimation of birth-death processes and developing RevBayes, a flexible and powerful tool for doing inference under phylogenetic models.

Welcome, Sebastian, and thanks for participating.
