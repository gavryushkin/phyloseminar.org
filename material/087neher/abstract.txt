Many large microbial populations are genetically diverse and consist of
many strains that compete against each other. Competition for
susceptible humans, for example, drives the immune escape dynamics of
seasonal influenza viruses. I will discuss how such competitive
non-neutral dynamics differ from typical population genetic models based
on the Kingman coalescent. If many small effect mutation contribute to
fitness variation in the population, the evolutionary dynamics converges
towards a different universal coalescent process known as the
Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent which generates distinctly different tree
ensembles and diversity patters. I will then show how these insights
into the population genetics of rapid adaptation can be used to infer
relative fitness of individuals in a population from sequence data
sampled at a single time point.
