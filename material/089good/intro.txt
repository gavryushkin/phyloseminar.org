Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The current theme is branch-specific diversification inference, by which I mean learning about the diversification process via phylogenetics.
If this is macroevolution, then we're talking about speciation and extinction rates, and if this is microevolution, then we're talking about fitness estimation.
If you want to ask a question, you can either tweet @phyloseminar or type your question in the "live chat" box to the right of the video on YouTube.

Today's speaker is Ben Good.
Ben develops methods to infer fitness and predict evolutionary outcomes.
He did his Ph.D. with Michael Desai at Harvard, and then was a Miller fellow at UC Berkeley with Oskar Hallatchek.

Welcome, Ben, and thanks for participating.
