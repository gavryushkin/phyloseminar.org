Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms (MCMC) have become the workhorse of Bayesian phylogenetic inference since they were introduced in the late 1990's. One alternative to MCMC that has  been proposed for Bayesian inference of model parameters is variational Bayes. The main idea behind variational inference is to transform the posterior approximation of an intractable model into an optimization problem using a family of tractable densities. Although variational inference is growing in popularity in the machine learning community, until recently it has received relatively little attention in the field of phylogenetics.

In this talk, I will describe the basic ideas behind variational inference. First I will introduce variational inference form a statistical perspective. Second, I will show how variational inference can be applied to the phylogenetic problem using the Stan package, a probabilistic programming language. Finally, I will compare the performance and accuracy of variational inference to MCMC-based analyses using diverse phylogenetic models, including time trees and coalescent models.
