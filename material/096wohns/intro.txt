Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is tree sequences, and this the first talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions, or tweet @phyloseminar.

Today's speaker is Wilder Wohns.
Wilder is a Rhodes Scholar and a PhD student in statistics at Oxford, supervised by Gil McVean, Yan Wong, and Jerome Kelleher.
He did his bachelors at Harvard in Human Evolutionary Biology where he worked with Terry Capellini.
He then moved to the UK to do his Masters at Cambridge with Toomas Kivisild (pronunciation: Tu-mas, Kiv-is-ild), where he studied the effects of the Black Death using ancient DNA.
Currently he is developing methods to efficiently estimate the age of ancestors in a tree sequence and to infer genealogies with large numbers of ancient and modern genomes.

Welcome, Wilder, and thanks for speaking to us today.
