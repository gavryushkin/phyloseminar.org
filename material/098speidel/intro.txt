Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is tree sequences, and this the third talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions, or tweet @phyloseminar.

Today's speaker is Leo Speidel.
Leo is a postdoc in Simon Myersâ€™ group at the Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, where he completed his PhD last year.
His PhD focused on developing Relate, a method for inferring genealogies genome-wide for many thousands of samples.
Currently, he is working on extending this framework, as well as on developing powerful methods that take inferred genealogies as input to answer a broad range of questions relating to population genetics.
