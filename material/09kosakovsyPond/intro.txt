 
Hello everyone and welcome to phyloseminar.org. 
This is the ninth seminar, and the last in our series on phylogenetics and infectious disease.
The next collection of talks is going to be on links between macroevolutionary models and phylogenetics.

Let me remind you that if you have a question during the talk, please type it into the message box and I will read it to the speaker, or let me know that you would like for me to turn on your audio.
 
We are very lucky to have Sergei Kosakovsky Pond speaking to us today.
Sergei is especially well known for his work developing methods in molecular evolution focused on the study of viruses, and for developing the HyPhy software package for likelihood-based testing of phylogenetic hypotheses.
He currently an Assistant Professor at the UCSD school of medicine.
His talk today is entitled "Accurate estimation of evolutionary attributes of coding sequences and pattern analysis in large collections of viral and mammalian genes."
