I will describe a collaborative effort to address evolutionary questions on the recent emergence of human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 including the role of reservoir species, the role of recombination, and its time of divergence from animal viruses. Our findings indicate that sarbecoviruses – the viral subgenus containing SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 – undergo frequent recombination and exhibit spatially structured genetic diversity on a regional scale in China. Contrary to other analyses, we find that SARS-CoV-2 itself is not a recombinant of any sarbecoviruses detected to date, and its receptor binding motif, important for specificity to human ACE2 receptors, appears to be an ancestral trait shared with bat viruses, not one acquired recently via recombination. Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir indicates that the lineage giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed in bats for decades.

Following the emergence of the virus, unprecedented sequencing efforts have resulted in the accumulation of more than 100,000 genome sequences sampled globally. Despite this rich source of information, evolutionary reconstructions are hindered by the slow accumulation of sequence divergence over its relatively short history of transmission and by the spatiotemporal bias in genome sampling. I will describe a phylodynamic data integration approach in a Bayesian framework and demonstrate how it helps addressing questions about SARS-CoV-2 molecular epidemiology.
