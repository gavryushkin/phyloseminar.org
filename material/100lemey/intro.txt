Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is on the novel coronavirus, and this the second talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions, or tweet @phyloseminar.

Today's speaker is Philippe Lemey.
Philippe got his masters in pharmaceutical sciences, then a masters in bioinformatics, then his PhD in medical sciences, all at the University of Leuven, where he is now faculty.
I'm sure that many of you are familiar with his work, as he is one of the true thought leaders on using phylogeny to inform infectious disease control.
He has 362 publications, including many this year that have been the definitive work on SARS-CoV-2.

Welcome, Philippe, and thank you for participating!
