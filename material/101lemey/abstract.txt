The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has prompted an unprecedented, global sequencing effort, which has greatly shaped our understanding of how the virus has spread around the world. However, attempts to incorporate large-scale genetic data into epidemiological investigations remains a significant challenge. The relatively slow evolutionary rate of the virus combined with intense sampling makes estimating a single, resolved phylogenetic tree difficult if not impossible. Additionally, Bayesian approaches, which naturally account for topological uncertainty, are untenable due to the size of tree-space to be explored as well as the computational burden of calculating the likelihood of large candidate trees. In order to make complex phylodynamic models tractable in this setting, we have extended a classic Bayesian method for estimating time trees from phylogenies which simplifies the likelihood calculation and constrains tree-space. Combined with a number of computational optimisations recently implemented in BEAST, this approach allows for efficient, complex analyses of datasets with tens of thousands of genomes. We have applied these methods to the large dataset produced by the COG-UK consortium to investigate SARS-CoV-2 import into the UK as well as its subsequent spread.
