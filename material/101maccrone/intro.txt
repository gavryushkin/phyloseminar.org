Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is on the novel coronavirus, and this the third talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.

Today's speaker is JT MacCrone.
JT got his PhD with Adam Lauring at the University of Michigan in Microbiology and Immunology, where he researched influenza virus evolution within and between human hosts.
He then joined Andrew Rambaut's group in 2018, where he has been working on monitoring viral outbreaks in real time, including, of course, SARS-CoV-2.

Welcome, JT, and thank you for participating!
