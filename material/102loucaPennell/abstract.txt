Time-calibrated phylogenies of extant species are widely used for estimating historical diversification dynamics.  However, since the original development of methods to do so, there has been controversy over the validity of this approach. Over the years, there have been a number of empirical case studies and simulation experiments that have sought to characterize the reliability of diversification rate estimators but  it has been difficult to make general claims about when we might be able to accurately distinguish between alternative historical scenarios and when we cannot. In a recent paper, we mathematically solved this problem and, in doing so, proved the existence of vast ‘congruent’ sets of alternative diversification scenarios that cannot be distinguished using extant timetrees alone. In this talk, we will present the derivations of our key results and provide some perspective on our statistical approach to the problem, which will highlight how and why our findings differ from previous work. We will show that far from being a mathematical curiosity, our results fundamentally challenge previous interpretations of empirical data and demonstrate this with some new analyses. We will end the talk by exploring whether our approach and our reasoning could be applied to related types of phylogenetic models.
