Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is on the identifiability of birth-death models, and this the first talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.
I've decided to stop monitoring twitter for questions.

Today's speakers are Stilianos Louca and Matt Pennell.
Dr. Louca is an Assistant Professor at the University of Oregon. I have a background in physics, mathematics and computation. He did my PhD at the University of British Columbia, Canada, in applied mathematics, where I developed my fascination for microbiology and the associated data-boom.
Dr. Pennell is an Assistant Professor and Canada Research Chair in Biodiversity Theory and Informatics at the University of British Columbia. I got my PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the University of Idaho, working with Luke Harmon. The primary focus of my research is figuring out how to use phylogenetic data to learn about macroevolution and comparative biology.

Welcome, both, and thank you for participating!
