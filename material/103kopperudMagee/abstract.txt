Recently, the discovery of congruent sets of phylogenetic birth-death
processes has raised a series of questions as to what diversification
patterns we can infer from phylogenetic trees and which are
indistinguishable. Many phylogenetic trees are estimated solely from
extant samples, and thus yield ultrametric trees that lack critical
information (i.e., extinction events) about the tempo of diversification
histories. This is the crux of the problem, and makes models in the same
congruence class statistically unidentifiable. However, the general
behaviour for such classes is not well known. How similar are these
classes, are they easy to construct, and is it possible to mimic any
plausible diversification history within one single class? To answer
this, we simulate a series of phylogenetic trees, both within and across
congruence classes, and investigate their properties using state of the
art Bayesian inference methods. Our results show that the
diversification rates inferred using Bayesian shrinkage priors produce
not an arbitrary model from the congruence class. Instead, using
Bayesian shrinkage priors collapses the congruence class, yielding a
single, simplest model in accordance with the prior expectations. Thus,
diversification rate can be inferred from molecular phylogenies when
realistic priors are used.
