Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is on the identifiability of birth-death models, and this the second talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.
I've decided to stop monitoring twitter for questions.

Today's speakers are Bjorn Kopperud and Andy Magee.
Bjørn did his master's degree at the University of Oslo, studying brain-size evolution in ungulates, using macroevolutionary models of adaptation. He has also worked on text-mining paleontological data using natural language processing techniques, in the little-known phylum of Bryozoa, or moss animals.
In 2020 he started his PhD studying diversification moels under Sebastian Höhna.
Andy is a PhD student in the Department of Biology at the University of Washington, Seattle, co-advised by Erick Matsen and Vladimir Minin.
He studies Bayesian phylogenetic methods with a focus on birth-death processes.

Welcome, both, and thank you for participating!
