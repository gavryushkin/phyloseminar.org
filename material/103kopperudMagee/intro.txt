Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is on the identifiability of birth-death models, and this the second talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.
I've decided to stop monitoring twitter for questions.

Today's speakers are Bjorn Kopperud and Andy Magee.
Bjørn did his master's degree at the University of Oslo, using macroevolutionary models of adaptation, and in 2020 he started his PhD studying diversification moels under Sebastian Höhna.
Andy is a PhD student in the Department of Biology at the University of Washington, co-advised by myself and Vladimir Minin. Andy studies Bayesian phylogenetic methods with a focus on birth-death processes.

Welcome, both, and thank you for participating!
