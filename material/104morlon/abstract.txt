Phylogenies of extant species are widely used to study past diversification dynamics. Over the last three decades, new phylogenetic tools have been developed that allow accounting for variations in diversification rates in time and across lineages. Important efforts have also been made to extend these tools in order to incorporate information from the fossil record. Despite their utility, these tools are regularly given bad press, on the basis that they may not infer true diversification histories. I clarify here what we can expect from models, and argue that the birth-death models used to infer diversification dynamics behave as expected. I also argue that the current approach in the field, which models speciation and extinction rates, provides the proper framework to make progress in our understanding of past diversification histories.
