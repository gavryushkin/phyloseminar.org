Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is on the identifiability of birth-death models, and this the third talk in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions.
I've decided to stop monitoring twitter for questions.

Today's speaker is Helene Morlon.
After a training in mathematics, I did my Masters and PhD in ecology in France. I then spent 5 years ½ as a postdoctoral researcher in ecology and evolution at UC Merced, the UO Eugene, UPenn and UC Berkeley. I am now a CNRS research director at the Institute of Biology of the Ecole Normale Supérieure. My lab is interested in understanding how historical and contemporary processes shape present-day patterns of biological diversity.

Welcome, Helene, and thank you for participating!
