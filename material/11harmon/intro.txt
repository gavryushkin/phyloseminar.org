Today, we are very excited to have Luke Harmon speaking on phyloseminar.
This is the second talk in a series on macroevolution and phylogenetics.
Next, Luke Harmon will be speaking on Thursday, February 24th at 9h PST.
Then, Brian O'Meara will be giving a talk Wednesday, March 16th, with, apparently a lot of new material.

Before we start, I notice that many of you are here for the first time.
Welcome!
We encourage questions during the talk, if you have one you can do one of two things. First you can just type your question into the meeting message box. Alternatively, you can type there that you have a question. In that case I will stop Joe and turn on your microphone. If you decide to do that, then please make sure your audio is debugged before hand, and that you are using some system which will not give us an echo, such as headphones.

I first became aware of Luke Harmon's work when I was getting a paper reviewed.
We had developed a summary statistic on phylogenies with timing information, while he of course had developed a full likelihood-based approach.
I'm glad that he has continued this work, which he will present today.
He is now an assistant professor at the university of Idaho, with a quickly growing lab.
