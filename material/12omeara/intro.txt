Today, we are very excited to have Brian O'Meara speaking on phyloseminar.
This is the third and final talk in a series on macroevolution and phylogenetics.
Next will be a series on evolutionary genomics.
The first talk in that series will be Mike Lin speaking on March 26th at
12am pst.  He will be presenting his fascinating work on looking for
overlapping functions in genomes.

Before we start, I notice that some of you are here for the first time.
Welcome!
We encourage questions during the talk, if you have one you can do one
of two things. First you can just type your question into the meeting
message box. Alternatively, you can type there that you have a question.
In that case I will stop the speaker and turn on your microphone. If you
decide to do that, then please make sure your audio is debugged before
hand, and that you are using some system which will not give us an echo,
such as headphones.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Brian O'Meara.
I'm proud to have him speaking today, because his focus is exactly where
we should be working-- on developing techniques for answering questions
using phylogenetics, and on making those techniques accessible to the
wider biological comminity.
Brian is an assistant professor at the University of Tenessee,
Knoxville. He is part of the national institute for mathematical and
biological synthesis.
