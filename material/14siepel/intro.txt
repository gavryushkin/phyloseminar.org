Today, we are very excited to have Adam Siepel speaking on phyloseminar.
This is the second talk in a series on evolutionary genomics.
The next talk in this series will be Jason Stajich speaking on June 29th
at 12pm PST.

We encourage questions during the talk, if you have one you can do one
of two things. First you can just type your question into the meeting
message box. Alternatively, you can type there that you have a question.
In that case I will stop the speaker and turn on your microphone. If you
decide to do that, then please make sure your audio is debugged before
hand, and that you are using some system which will not give us an echo,
such as headphones.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Adam Siepel.
I was most familiar with his work on phylo-HMMs with David Haussler and
others, but I was pretty impressed looking through his list of
publications.
Here are some examples.
A computer program designed to screen rapidly for HIV Type 1
intersubtype recombinant sequences with Bette Korber back in 1995.
Then he got interested in gene order phylogeny, OK, I was interested in
that too, and then...
A simplified hillslope erosion model with vegetation elements for
practical applications in the Journal of Hydrology.?
Well, anyway, I should let him get on with his talk entitled
"Bayesian inference of ancient human demography from individual genome
sequences"
