Today, we are very excited to have Jason Stajich speaking on phyloseminar.
This is the third and final talk in a series on evolutionary genomics.

We encourage questions during the talk, if you have one you can do one
of two things. First you can just type your question into the meeting
message box. Alternatively, you can type there that you have a question.
In that case I will stop the speaker and turn on your microphone. If you
decide to do that, then please make sure your audio is debugged before
hand, and that you are using some system which will not give us an echo,
such as headphones.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Jason Stajich.
Jason is one of my heroes.
He's this young guy who integrates computation and biology to the benefit of both.
He is of course an expert in fungal genomics, and has used this system as a way to get at fundamental questions of genome evolution.
He's also developed a number of tools to make other people's work easier.
Of course, people from a variety of biological fields know him as one of the primary contributors to bioperl, but he's done quite a variety of things, including the recently launched FungiDB.
In any case, I'm very happy to have him speaking today.
His talk is entitled "Fungal phylogenomics: Getting lost in the moldy forest."
