The key component of a probabilistic joint approach to tree
and alignment inference is a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) over
strings. Ideally, this CTMC should support tractable inference
algorithms and should be easily extensible to support a wide range of
evolutionary models. The classical string-valued CTMC, the TKF91 model
(Thorne et al., 1991), is limited in both of these axes. Previous work
has focussed on increasing the complexity of the TKF91 model, making
the inference problem computationally more difficult (Miklos et al.,
2004).

In this work, we present a new stochastic process, the Poisson Indel
Process (PIP), which allows simple and practical inference algorithms.
Efficient computations are based on an exchangeable representation and
on Poisson processes. This representation gives a natural way of
extending the capacity of the model while keeping inference
computationally practical.

We used this process to design a joint Bayesian estimator over
alignments and trees. We evaluated both consensus trees and alignments
against standard baselines on synthetic and real data. These
experiments demonstrate that competitive trees and alignments can be
inferred using a Bayesian model equipped with a PIP prior.
