Charles Darwin famously noted that there were many curious parallels between
the evolution of species and languages. Since then evolutionary biology and
historical linguistics have used trees to conceptualise evolution. However,
whilst evolutionary biology developed the vast discipline of phylogenetic
methods, linguistics dabbled with computational methods before rejecting them.
The last decade or so has seen the introduction of phylogenetic methods into
linguistics, often with some startling results. In this talk I will present
some of these studies, and discuss how phylogenetics can help us grapple with
the problems of linguistic and cultural evolution. These problems range from
testing population dispersal hypotheses, to investigating the shape of cultural
evolution, to inferring the rates at which languages change.
