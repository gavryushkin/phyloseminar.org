Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org. We encourage questions
during the talk, if you have a question please go ahead and type your
question into the meeting message box.

This is the second talk in a three-part series of talks on phylogenetics and
language. First we heard from Simon Greenhill, today we are going to hear from
Fiona Jordan, and then next we are going to have Tom Currie.

Fiona did her honours in biology and psychology with Russell Gray at the
University of Auckland, then her PhD in biological anthropology with Ruth Mace
at University College London. Before that (2007-2009) I was a postdoc in the
AHRC Centre for the Evolution of Cultural Diversity at University College
London. From 2009-2012 I worked at the Max Planck Institute for
Psycholinguistics, in the Evolutionary Processes in Language and Culture group.
I am a Lecturer in Anthropology in the University of Bristolâ€™s Archaeology &
Anthropology department.
