Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org. We encourage questions during
the talk, if you have a question please go ahead and type your question into
the meeting message box.

This is the third talk in a three-part series of talks on phylogenetics and
language. First we heard from Simon Greenhill, then Fiona Jordan, and today we
are going to hear from Tom Currie.

Thomas got his PhD in Evolutionary Anthropology 2009 from University College
London. This included a visit to the lab of Russell Gray in Auckland, the
source of many great things phylo-linguistical. He was then a postdoc at the
Hasegawa laboratory in Tokyo, and then did another postdoc at UCL. He has
recently accepted a position as lecturer at the University of Exeter in the UK.

Today Tom is going to tell us about connections between the linguistic and
biological worlds, and similar challenges they face from non-treelike
evolution.
