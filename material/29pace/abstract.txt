Carl Woese, one of the great scientists of all time, died in December, 2012.
Among other important contributions, he used primitive sequencing technology to
compare small subunit (16S) ribosomal RNA sequences from different organisms
and thereby establish the outlines of a universal tree of life.  His results
also put in place a sequence-based reference framework within which to
understand and articulate biological diversity.  Since this perspective is
based on molecular sequences and not properties of organisms, it opened the
door to begin to understand the kinds of organisms that make up the natural
microbial world.  Prior to Woese’s sequence-based reference framework,
microbial ecologists had to culture organisms to study them, but not many
environmental organisms, <<1%, are cultured using standard methods.  Sequence
surveys of environmental microbial genes and genomes – “metagenomics” - have
now revolutionized understanding of microbial ecology, including its influence
on human health.  The seminar will discuss how metagenomics developed and the
impact it has had on our understanding of environmental microbial diversity and
the structure of the molecular tree of life.
