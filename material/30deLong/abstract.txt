The challenges of dissecting naturally occurring microbial assemblages, with
respect to their community composition, interspecies interactions, functional
attributes, and activities, are numerous and daunting. For many years, these
challenges impeded our understanding of the properties and dynamics of
microbial communities, and thus hindered development of the field of microbial
ecology. Enter Carl Woese: the theory and application of molecular
phylogenetics and genomics in studies of microbial evolution and ecology can be
traced directly to Woese and one of his primary collaborators, Norman Pace.
This lecture will trace the logic and roots of the application of molecular
phylogenetics and genomics to the study of microbial ecology, through a
historical review and examination of its past and current applications.
