Most microorganisms cannot be grown in pure culture (or at least not
easily). This has been apparent for decades by comparing the number of
cells seen under a microscope to the fraction of those cells that will
grow into colony forming units (typically <1%). The objective
classification of cellular life by comparative rRNA analysis pioneered by
Carl Woese provided the first grand view of the tree of life and also
provided the reference framework upon which his friend and colleague,
Norman Pace, developed ways to directly survey microbial communities via
their rRNA sequences without the need to grow them. This put our degree of
ignorance of the microbial world into perspective: dozens of major
microbial lineages have emerged over the last 20 years that lack even a
single cultured representative. New approaches, such as deep metagenomics
and single cell genomics, are now transforming the rRNA-based phylogenetic
outlines of the tree of life into a fully-fledged genome-based view of the
tree. I will present a recent snapshot overview of the genome tree of the
bacterial and archaeal domains and examples of functional insights in the
context of a more complete view of microbial evolution.
