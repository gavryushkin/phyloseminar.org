Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

Before we get started I would like to gratefully acknowledge the support of the Society of Systematic Biologists, which is now supporting phyloseminar.

Today is the second talk of a series of three talks on the promise and challenges of using fossils in phylogenetics.
Our first speaker on this subject was Tracy Heath on the Fossilized Birth Death process.
Today we have Dan Ksepka on "Integrating Fossils into phylogenies".
Dan will be followed by Graham Slater who will be speaking in a week.

Dan is a paleontologist by training. He got his bachelors in Geology at Rutgers, then his masters and PhD at Columbia.
There he started working on extinct penguins, which is a significant interest of his that has continued to the present day.
In looking this morning at his work, I could certainly see the appeal, as this group is quite old and diverse.
Dan is currently a researcher at NC state and NESCent.

Ironically, I'm heading to NESCent this morning for a BEAST2 workshop, and my schedule is such that I won't be able to stay for Dan's whole talk.
So, it's going to be up to the rest of you to ask the moronic questions that are usually my role here!
