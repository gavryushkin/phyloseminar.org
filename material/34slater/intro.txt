Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

First I would like to gratefully acknowledge the support of the Society of Systematic Biologists.

Today is the third talk of a series of three talks on the promise and challenges of using fossils in phylogenetics.
Our first speaker on this subject was Tracy Heath on the Fossilized Birth Death process, and then we had Dan Ksepka who gave a very interesting and practical description of integrating fossils into phylogenies.
Today we have Graham Slater.

Graham is a evolutionary biologist by training. He got his bachelors in Zoology at University College London, and his PhD at UCLA.
He has recently done quite a lot of interesting methods work, such as developing methods for Approximate Bayesian Computation using incompletely sampled data, and most recently using posterior predictive simulation to detect early bursts of evolution.
He is a co-editor on a recent special issue of Methods in Ecology and Evolution on using fossils and phylogenies for comparative analyses of diversification and trait evolution, so I suggest looking at that for more details.
He one of the people pushing forward development of comparative evolutionary methods in the R language, and is a major contributor to Luke Harmon's GEIGER package.
Biologically speaking he is interested in cats and dogs.
Graham is currently a researcher at the Smithsonian.

Welcome, Graham, to phyloseminar, and I'm looking forward to your talk.
