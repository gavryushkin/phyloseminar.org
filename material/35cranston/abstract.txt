Open Tree of Life aims to synthesize published phylogenetic data into a comprehensive tree of life. The challenges associated with the collection, curation and synthesis of both phylogenetic and taxonomic input data are both technical and social. We present the first draft of the Open Tree of Life, as well as the workflow and software tools for curating, annotating and viewing phylogenetic data. In a subsequent Phyloseminar, Stephen Smith will present details of the phylogenetic synthesis methods.
