Genome rearrangements were discovered and used to build molecular phylogenies in the 1930s. They are implied in many cancers and their evolutionary role might be of primary importance. But the mathematical and computational tools to model rearrangements are still not as efficient as the ones developed later for local mutations as nucleotide or amino-acid substitutions. In this seminar I will report the attempts to integrate genome organisations in the usual models of genome evolution. I will explain how this can improve the inference of phylogenies, as well as ancestral genomes.
