Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the
Society of Systematic Biologists.

Today is the second talk in a series of two talks on phylogenetic approaches to
cancer. Two weeks ago we heard from Kamila Naxerova, and today we will have Roland
Schwarz from Nick Goldman's group speaking on the phylogenetic quantification of
intra-tumour heterogeneity.

Roland did his undergraduate and then PhD work at the university of Wurzburg, where he developed machine learning methods for the study of microbiology, and graduated in 2009.
Since then he has been in Nick Goldman's group at Cambridge, working on a variety of problems using machine learning techniques.
I really encourage you to take a look at his publication list, that I've posted on the Google plus page.
This guy has worked on everything from theoretical models of cell size to multiple sequence alignment to now molecular evolution in cancer.
He has been a Marie Curie fellow at the EBI since 2012, and has one more year before going on the job market.
Thank you for speaking, Roland, and I'm looking forward to your talk.
