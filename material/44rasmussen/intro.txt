Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the Society of Systematic Biologists.

Today is the third talk in a series of three talks on viral phylodynamics.
Two weeks ago we heard from Erik Volz, and last week we had Matthew Hall from Edinburgh.
Those recordings are now up.
Today we will have David Rasmussen, who will be introduced by Trevor.
