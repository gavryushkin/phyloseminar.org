Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the
Society of Systematic Biologists.

Today is the first talk in a series of three talks on ancestral recombination
graphs. Today we are going to hear from Matt Rasmussen, now at Counsyl, then we
are going to hear from Peter Ralph from USC, and finally from Matthias
Steinrucken speaking from his new position at UMass Amherst.

Matt did his undergraduate at the University of Minnesota in CS, then his
masters and PhD at MIT under the supervision of Manolis Kellis. If you haven't
checked out Matt's work he did for his PhD, I encourage you to do so,
especially the work on species tree reconstruction in the presence of gene
duplication, loss, and lineage sorting. That's a really hard problem, and I
don't think that his work has gotten quite as much attention from the
phylogenetics community as it deserves. He then worked with Adam Siepel at
Cornell, and started working on the related problem of inference of ancestral
recombination graphs, which is what he's going to be talking about today.
