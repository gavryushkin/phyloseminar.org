Often, the summary statistics of population genetics are framed in the
setting of Kingman's coalescent or related models.  These statistics
can be alternatively thought of as descriptive statistics of the
realized population pedigree-with-recombination, in a way that has
become much more useful in the era of whole-genome sequencing.  For
instance, pairwise number of nucleotide differences is proportional to
"effective population size", which is sometimes more usefully thought
of as an estimate of the average length of the path through the
pedigree to the most recent common ancestor at a randomly chosen locus
(with an explicit standard error). Another example is the pairwise
distribution of long tracts of IBD, which provides an estimate of a
functional of the entire distribution of such paths.
