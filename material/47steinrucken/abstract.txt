Complex demographic histories can have a substantial impact on the genetic variation observed today. Due to the process of chromosomal recombination the genomes of contemporary individuals are mosaics comprised of different DNA segments from individuals in the same or closely related sub-populations. Uncovering the distribution of these tracts has not only substantial power to inform about ancient demographic events, but is also helpful for revealing the origin of specific genetic variation, in scenarios of gene-flow between populations.

In this talk, I present a novel demography-aware conditional sampling distribution (CSD) that can be used to detect these tracts of local ancestry in genomic sequence data. We make implicit use of the distribution of these tracts, by applying this CSD in an expectation-maximization framework for demographic inference. We show that this method can accurately recover biologically relevant demographic parameters like population divergence times, migration rates, or ancestral population sizes from simulated datasets. Furthermore, we apply the CSD to detect tracts of introgressed genetic material from Neanderthal into modern humans. Our results are in general agreement with previously published results, and we will discuss the similarities and differences, and their biological implications.
