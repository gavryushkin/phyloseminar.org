Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the
Society of Systematic Biologists.

As you are no doubt aware, a little more than a year ago there were a series
of events that led to the current epidemic of Ebola hemhorragic fever. Since
that time, there have been over 26,000 cases and over 10,000 mortalities.
The epidemic still rages in Sierra Leone and Guinea.

As part of this, the molecular evolution of the Ebola virus has been a subject
of considerable interest by researchers and the general public.
Today we have the second talk in a series of two talks by a pair of
collaborators, Danny Park and Gytis Dudas, who are key parts of a larger team
really driving our understanding of the transmission routes and the
evolutionary trajectory of Ebola.
Today we are going to hear from Gytis Dudas, who will follow up on Danny's
overview by giving the analysis details and results from the evolutionary
analysis of the Ebola sequences from Sierra Leone.

Gytis got his undergraduate degree in Edinburgh, and is currently a PhD student
with Andrew Rambaut.
I am pleased to note that he will be starting a postdoc soon with Trevor
Bedford here at Fred Hutch, so he'll be just a couple of doors down.

Welcome, Gytis, and I'm looking forward to your talk.
