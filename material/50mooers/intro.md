Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the
Society of Systematic Biologists.

Today is the 50th phyloseminar, and I'd like to thank everyone who has participated, and especially our 50 fantastic speakers.

The next three talks are going to be about phylogenetic approaches to genetic conservation, or as Arne decided, phylo-Genetic conservation.
Arne helped organize this trio of talks, and selected our distinguished collection of speakers, which includes Catherine Graham and then Sandrine Pavoine.
Arne is going to be speaking first, and will give an opinionated overview.

Arne has consistently made important contributions to macroevolutionary thinking, but more importantly has consistently worked to apply that thinking more broadly.
This includes contributions from understanding climate shifts to identifying species that are very important for diversity yet are teetering on the brink of extinction.
On a personal note, Arne is one of the first evolutionary biologists I talked to in my transition from math, and I'm very grateful to him for his warm welcome into the field.

Arne has been a professor in British Columbia, first at UBC and now SFU, for decades now, published a long list of papers, and has mentored many students, including Rutger Vos.
Welcome, Arne, and I'm looking forward to your talk.
