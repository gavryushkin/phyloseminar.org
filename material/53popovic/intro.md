Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the
Society of Systematic Biologists.

The next three talks are on the theme of biased sampling in phylogenetics: what does it do to our inferences and what can we do about it.
Today's talk is going to be a theoretical perspective from probabilist Lea Popovic.
The next talk will be from Vladimir Minin concerning about a new model that explicitly accounts for preferential sampling, and then Nicola de Maio, who will discuss the sensitivity of discrete trait methods to sampling strategy.

As I mentioned, today we have a talk from Lea Popovic.
Lea has her Ph.D. in Statistics from UC Berkeley, where she worked with probabilist David Aldous.
She then did a postdoc at the Institute for Mathematics and Applications at the University of Minnesota, then another postdoc at Cornell.
After that she took a faculty position at Concordia University, where she has been since 2007.
In addition to work on macroevolutionary models and the tree of life, she works on probabilistic analysis of chemical reaction networks.
Welcome, Lea, and I'm looking forward to your talk.
