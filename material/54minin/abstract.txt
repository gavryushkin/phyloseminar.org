Phylodynamics seeks to estimate effective population size fluctuations from molecular sequences of individuals sampled from a population of interest. However, when analyzing sequences sampled serially through time, current methods implicitly assume either that sampling times are fixed deterministically by the data collection protocol or that their distribution does not depend on the size of the population. Through simulation, we first show that, when sampling times do probabilistically depend on effective population size, estimation methods may be systematically biased. To correct for this deficiency, we propose a new model that explicitly accounts for preferential sampling by modeling the sampling times as an inhomogeneous Poisson process dependent on effective population size. We demonstrate that in the presence of preferential sampling our new model not only reduces bias, but also improves estimation precision. Finally, we compare the performance of the currently used phylodynamic methods with our proposed model through seasonal human influenza examples. Our analysis demonstrates that influenza data sets constructed by mining sequence databases do contain strong preferential sampling signal. Accounting for this preferential sampling produces a markedly cleaner picture of influenza population dynamics.
