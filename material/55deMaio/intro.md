Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the
Society of Systematic Biologists.

We are in the middle of three talks on the theme of biased sampling in phylogenetics: what does it do to our inferences and what can we do about it.
We started with a theoretical perspective from probabilist Lea Popovic.
Then we had a talk from Vladimir Minin concerning about a new model that explicitly accounts for preferential sampling.
Today we have a talk from Nicola de Maio, who will discuss the sensitivity of discrete trait methods to sampling strategy.

Q&A app...

As I mentioned, today we have a talk from Nicola de Maio.
Nicola did his undergraduate work in his native Italy, and then went to Austria to work with Carolin Koisol in Austria.
There he did some very nice and important work integrating allele frequency information with sequence data for phylogenetic estimation.
In 2013 he moved to Oxford under a James Martin Research Fellowship.
While there he's been working on a new approach to phylogeography via a structured coalescent approximation, which he'll be telling us about today.
