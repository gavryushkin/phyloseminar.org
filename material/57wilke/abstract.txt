Proteins are under selective constraints to fold stably into their native conformation and to carry out their biological function. These selective constraints shape how proteins evolve, and they cause variation in substitution rates among the sites within a given protein. In particular, sites in the core of a protein, with many residue-residue contacts, tend to be more conserved than sites on the protein surface. Further, catalytic residues in enzymes are highly conserved, and they impart a measurable increase in conservation to much of the enzyme structure, in a distance-dependent manner. (The further a site is from a catalytic residue, the less extra conservation it experiences.) Finally, protein-protein interfaces show a surprising ability for evolutionary divergence, even if they are strongly selected for function.
