Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the Society of Systematic Biologists.

Today we are going to hear from Joe Felsenstein, who was one of the initial developers of statistical phylogenetics, and has continued to lead the field throughout his career.
This list of his achievements in the field reads like a catalog of its primary advances, including the Felsenstein algorithm for efficient likelihood computation on trees, the use of the bootstrap to infer per-branch confidence levels, MCMC methods for population and migration parameter inference, the phylogenetic comparative method, etcetera etcetera.
Joe started the PHYLIP suite of phylogenetic inference programs before MS-DOS, and has continued to maintain it to this day, which I think must be some sort of record in bioinformatics.
The internals of the code have been massively influential, and one can trace many characteristics of more recent high-performance phylogenetic inference packages back to Joe's original implementation.

Despite these massive achievements, my impression is that Joe thinks of himself as a geneticist first and foremost, and indeed he has made many contributions to the fields of population genetics and molecular evolution.
If you are interested in Joe's perspective on population genetics, and on how phylogenetics has become something of a distraction from population genetics, I encourage you to listen to Joe's talk on a history of population genetics, which I've posted on the G+ page.

I'd like to remind people that you can ask questions through the Q&A app available on google hangouts.
I'll also be monitoring the @phyloseminar twitter account if you would like to ask questions that way.
So, without further ado, please welcome Joe Felsenstein.
