Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org, a project supported by the Society of Systematic Biologists.

In this series of 3 talks, we are looking at phylogenetic opportunities and challenges from bacteria and archaea.
Our first talk was from Laura Hug about recent discoveries of new groups of organisms, then we heard from Xavier Didelot, and today we are hearing from Tim Vaughan.

I wanted to remind people that the Q&A app is gone now, so you can ask questions through Twitter or IRC, as described in the "attending" section of the phyloseminar website.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Tim Vaughan.
Tim got his PhD in theoretical physics in 2008 from the University of Queensland.
Directly after his PhD he spent a year in Geoff Goodhill's neuroscience lab as a research assistant.
He then started working with Peter Drummond and Alexei Drummond modelling within-host viral dynamics, which led to a bunch of visits to Auckland, where he discovered phylogenetics.
He is now a postdoc in the computational evolution group at the University of Auckland.

Welcome, Tim, and thanks for participating.
