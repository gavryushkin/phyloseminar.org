Talks in this series have largely focused on population genetic and phylogenetic methods for reconstructing micro- and macroevolutionary patterns consequent from microevolutionary processes. When natural selection is invoked, it is generally assumed to operate through the differential reproduction of favored variants among populations of physical entities, be they genes, cells, organisms or (rarely) species. The Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock, co-developed and vigorously promoted by Lynn Margulis in the 1970s, has been very popular with the lay public. But most mainstream Darwinists scorned and still do not accept the notion. They cannot imagine global biospheric stability being selected for at any of the above levels, and do not see the Earth's biosphere as part of a population of comparable global entities engaged in reproductive competition. Most philosophers of biology would similarly argue that any global homeostatic systems (if they exist) can be only "fortuitous byproducts" of lower-level selection. I will suggest that we look at the biogeochemical cycles and other homeostatic processes that might confer stability-- rather than the individual organisms or "species" (mostly microbial) that implement them-- as the relevant units of selection. By thus focusing our attentions on the "song", not the "singers," a Darwinized Gaia might be developed. Our understanding of evolution by natural selection would however need to be stretched to accommodate differential persistence, and our definition of reproduction would need to be reworked.
