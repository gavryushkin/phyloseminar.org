Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

Today we have a special talk that's a little atypical.
We're going to take a break from our usual diet of methods and results from sequence analysis, and hear from W Ford Doolittle about philosophy.
Before I introduce Ford, I wanted to remind people that the Q&A app is gone now, so you can ask questions through Twitter or IRC, as described in the "attending" section of the phyloseminar website.

Dr. Doolittle is well known for his foundational work on the genetics of microorganisms.
This includes making significant contributions to the study of cyanobacteria, including evidence for the endosymbiont origins of chloroplasts, and showing the importance of horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotic evolution.
He led the research community in moving away from a single-tree representation of organismal evolution.
Dr. Doolittle received his PhD from Stanford University in 1967 under Charles Yanofsky, and did postdocs with Sol Spiegelman and Norman R. Pace.
He has been Professor Emeritus at Dalhousie since 2007.
He has many awards and titles, including being a member of the US National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society of Canada, the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, and is the winner of the 2014 Herzberg Medal of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

Welcome, Dr. Doolittle, and thanks for participating.
