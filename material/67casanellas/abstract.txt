It has been now thirty years since the introduction of phylogenetic invariants by Lake, Cavender, and Felsenstein. However, the use of phylogenetic invariants as a method of phylogenetic reconstruction has been in a dormant state for about 20 years; quoting J. Felsenstein in his 2004 book "invariants are worth attention, not for what they do for us now, but what they might lead to in the future".

During the last decade many efforts have been made by mathematicians to completely understand the structure and use of phylogenetic invariants. This has led to the characterization of different types of invariants for many different models: from the most simple Jukes-Cantor model to the general Markov model, and even mixtures of them and the coalescent. Most importantly, this has produced new and efficient methods of phylogenetic reconstruction for complex models. The use of invariants has also been used in model selection and has been crucial in proving the identifiability of parameters for certain models.

In this talk we shall introduce phylogenetic invariants, explain the main ideas that underlie the methods of phylogenetic reconstruction based on invariants and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of them.
