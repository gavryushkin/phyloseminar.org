Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

It has been known for decades that certain polynomial relationships hold for data generated from a tree.
These were first discovered in a pair of 1987 papers, one by Lake and one by Cavender and Felsenstein, and have obtained the name "phylogenetic invariants".
Mathematically speaking, invariants belong as a subject in algebraic geometry, and as such have been extensively studied by mathematicians.
Practically speaking, invariant methods have thus far had limited impact on inference, although it appears that this may be starting to change.

In this series of 3 talks, we are going to hear three perspectives on invariants and how they may used to make inferences.
We will start with Marta Casanellas Rius who give background and bring us up to date with research on invariants,
then we will have Laura Kubatko describe coalescent-based inference using invariants, and
third Barbara Holland will describe Markov invariants and how they differ from classical phylogenetic invariants.

I wanted to remind people that the Q&A app is gone now, so you can ask questions through Twitter or IRC, as described in the "attending" section of the phyloseminar website.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Marta Casanellas Rius.
Marta has spent most of her career in Barcelona, starting with her undergraduate and graduate work in theoretical algebraic geometry.
She then got a Fulbright fellowship to do a postdoc with Robin Hartshorne, who was a leading algebraic geometer at UC Berkeley.
In 2004 she turned her interest towards applications of algebraic geometry to phylogenetics, and since then she has been a leading researcher in the field.
She is now an Associate professor in the department of mathematics at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya.

Welcome, Marta, and thanks for participating.
