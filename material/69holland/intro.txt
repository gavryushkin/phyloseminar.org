Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The current theme is phylogenetic invariants, which are polynomial relationships on data generated from a tree.
In this series of 3 talks, we are hearing three perspectives on invariants and how they may used to make inferences.
First we heard from Marta Casanellas Rius who introduced the topic and brought us up to date.
Then we heard from Laura Kubatko describing coalescent-based inference using invariants, and
today Barbara Holland will describe Markov invariants and how they differ from classical phylogenetic invariants.

I wanted to remind people that the Q&A app is gone now, so you can ask questions through Twitter or IRC, as described in the "attending" section of the phyloseminar website.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Barbara Holland.
Barbara completed a PhD in Mathematical Biology at Massey University in New Zealand, followed by postdoctoral studies at the Ruhr UniversitÃ¤t Bochum in Germany and then further study at the Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and Evolution in New Zealand.
Prior to joining the University of Tasmania she worked as a Mathematics lecturer and researcher at Massey University.
Barbara Holland is an Associate Professor in Mathematics at the University of Tasmania, Australia.

Welcome, Barbara, and thanks for participating.
