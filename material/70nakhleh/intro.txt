Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The current theme is phylogenetic networks, which generalize trees by allowing loops in the graph.
In this series of 3 talks, we are hearing three perspectives on networks.
Today we will hear from Luay Nakhleh, who has been pioneering statistical inference of phylogenetic networks from multi-locus data.
In November we will hear from Celine Scornavacca on Occam's razor in phylogenetic network reconstruction,
and in December Cecile Ane will describe challenges in network inference as well as how one can use networks in phylogenetic comparative methods.

I wanted to remind people that the Q&A app is gone now, so you can ask questions through Twitter or IRC, as described in the "attending" section of the phyloseminar website.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Luay Nakhleh.
Luay is originally from Israel, where he got his BS from the Technion.
After this he did his MS at Texas A&M, and then his PhD at UT Austin under Tandy Warnow.
From there he went straight to a faculty position at Rice University in Huston, Texas, where he has risen to be chair of the department.

Welcome, Luay, and thanks for participating, especially after your recent adverse weather events!
