Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The current theme is phylogenetic networks, which generalize trees by allowing loops in the graph.
In this series of 3 talks, we are hearing three perspectives on networks.
First we heard from Luay Nakhleh, on statistical inference of phylogenetic networks from multi-locus data.
Then we heared from Celine Scornavacca on parsimony methods in phylogenetic network reconstruction.
Today Cecile Ane will describe challenges in network inference as well as how one can use networks in phylogenetic comparative methods.

I wanted to remind people that the Q&A app is gone now, so you can ask questions through Twitter or IRC, as described in the "attending" section of the phyloseminar website.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Cecile Ane.
Cecile is originally from from France, where she did her BS and MS in math, and then a PhD in probability, graduating in 2000.
I think we'll be able to see this background in the material she'll be presenting today.
Since then she has been at Wisconsin-Madison, joint between the departments of statistics and Botany.

Welcome, Cecile, and thanks for participating.
