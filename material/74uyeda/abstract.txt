The availability of phylogenetic trees based on molecular sequence data has revolutionized evolutionary biology by providing a map from which we can understand divergence and diversification across the tree of life. Numerous phylogenetic comparative approaches have opened up new avenues for testing macroevolutionary hypotheses regarding the drivers of the tempo and mode of trait evolution and lineage diversification. However, recent crises in the field have suggested that many of the methods we commonly use don't tell us what we would like them to. Specifically, I will show that unreplicated evolutionary events can break nearly every comparative method for testing associations from phylogenetically structured data. I will argue that one solution to this problem is to unite hypothesis testing with data-driven approaches, which I term "phylogenetic natural history", to disentangle the impact of singular shifts from replicated patterns of association. More generally, I will argue that we should abandon thinking of phylogenetic comparative methods as "corrections for statistical non-independence" and more meaningfully confront how our causal hypotheses map on to phylogenetically structured data.
