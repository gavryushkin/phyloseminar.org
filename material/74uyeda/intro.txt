Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The current theme is on phylogenetic models for continuous traits and their applications.
In this series of 3 talks, we are hearing three perspectives on continuous traits.
First we heard from Josh Schraiber on applications of phylogenetic continuous trait models to gene expression.
Today we will hear from Josf Uyeda on the need for phylogenetic natural history,
And then in March Michael Landis will describe his work on pulsed models for trait evolution.

If you want to ask a question, you can either tweet @phyloseminar or type your question in the "live chat" box to the right of the video on YouTube.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Josef Uyeda.
Josef got his PhD from Oregon State in Corvallis with Stevan Arnold, then did a postdoc with Luke Harmon at the University of Idaho, Moscow.
He has recently joined the faculty of biological sciences at Virginia Tech.

Welcome, Josef, and thanks for participating.
