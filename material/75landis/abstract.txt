One of the most apparent features of life is its diversity of forms. Biologists are especially driven to learn what evolutionary processes generated which components of life's variation. Central to this puzzle is whether or not phenotypic change tends to accumulate by slow but steady increments or by rare but sudden pulses. Although many phylogenetic models and methods are known for describing incremental change, such as Brownian motion and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, models of pulsed change have received less study, making it difficult to measure the prevalence of competing evolutionary modes. My talk provides an overview of evidence, theory, and methods that have advanced our understanding of evolutionary pulses of trait change. I share some of my contributions on the exploration of this topic, including recent findings that phylogenetic models of pulsed evolution explain a major component of vertebrate body size evolution. I conclude with some remarks regarding the potential for models of pulsed evolution to aid in the study of macroevolution.
