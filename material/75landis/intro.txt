Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The current theme is on phylogenetic models for continuous traits and their applications.
In this series of 3 talks, we are hearing three perspectives on continuous traits.
The first two talks were from Josh Schraiber and Josef Uyeda, and today Michael Landis will describe his work on pulsed models for trait evolution.

If you want to ask a question, you can either tweet @phyloseminar or type your question in the "live chat" box to the right of the video on YouTube.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Michael Landis.
Michael got his PhD in integrative biology with John Huelsenbeck at UC Berkeley.
After that he worked briefly with Tracy Heath at Iowa State, and is now a postdoc with Michael Donoghue at Yale.
Job market?
Welcome, Michael, and thanks for participating.
