Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

This is talk number 2 in a series of 4 talks introducing phylogenetics by master expositor Paul Lewis.
I've already introduced Paul in the first talk, so I will just let him get started.
If you want to ask a question, you can either tweet @phyloseminar or type your question in the "live chat" box to the right of the video on YouTube.
