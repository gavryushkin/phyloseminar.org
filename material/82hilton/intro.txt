Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The current theme is the adequacy phylogenetic models.
In this series of 3 talks, we are hearing three perspectives on model adequacy.
First we heard from Jeremy Brown on the role of model fit in resolving the tree of life.
Last time we heard from Sebastian DuchÃªne on model adequacy in infectious disease phylodynamics.
Today Sarah Hilton will describe her work on experimentally informed site-specific substitution models.

If you want to ask a question, you can either tweet @phyloseminar or type your question in the "live chat" box to the right of the video on YouTube.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Sarah Hilton.
Sarah is a graduate student in Genome Sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle, doing her PhD with Jesse Bloom at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

Welcome, Sarah, and thanks for participating.
