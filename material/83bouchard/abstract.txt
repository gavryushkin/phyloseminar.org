I will describe a Bayesian method to reconstruct single cell phylogenetic trees from copy number events such as those that arise in cancers with high genomic instability. The method is motivated by low-depth genome-wide data which can be obtained for increasingly large numbers of cells thanks to technologies such as Direct Library Preparation or 10x Single Cell Genomics. 

Computing the posterior distribution in this model at scale is challenging. I will describe how recent advances in the field of Bayesian computational statistics can be used to parallelize the posterior inference computation to an arbitrary number of cores, touching on topics such as non-reversible methods and change of measure approaches. 

The posterior inference methods described are available through an open source Bayesian modelling language called Blang (https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/blang/), which can be used for a range of phylogenetic problems including more traditional phylogenetic models, as well as other Bayesian analysis problems. The motivating copy-number-based phylogenetic model is implemented in Blang and available in a cancer Bayesian phylogenetics and population genetics library we are actively developing (https://github.com/UBC-Stat-ML/nowellpack). This library has been used to infer phylogenetic trees on >4000 cells using >60 cores.
