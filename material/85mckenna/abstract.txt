Multicellular organisms develop by way of a lineage tree, a series of cell divisions that give rise to cell types, tissues, and organs. This pattern mirrors the evolutionary relationships between species, though our knowledge of the cell lineage and its determinants remains extremely fragmentary for nearly all species. This includes all vertebrates and arthropods such as Drosophila, wherein cell lineage varies between individuals. Embryos and organs are often visually inaccessible, and progenitor cells disperse by long-distance migration. We recently pioneered a new paradigm for recording cell lineage and other aspects of developmental history that has the potential to enhance our understanding of vertebrate biology. In brief, we engineer cells to stochastically introduce mutations at specific locations in the genome during development. The resulting patterns of mutations, which can be efficiently queried by massively parallel sequencing, can be used to reconstruct lineage using methods adapted from phylogenetics. We demonstrate our technique by tracing the lineage of tens of thousands of cells within individual Zebrafish and Drosophila, relating the lineage of numerous emerging tissue and organ systems.
