Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The current theme is tree inference from non-traditional data.
Today we will hear from Aaron McKenna about inference of organismal differentiation using CRISPR arrays.
If you want to ask a question, you can either tweet @phyloseminar or type your question in the "live chat" box to the right of the video on YouTube.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Aaron McKenna.
Aaron is a postdoc in Jay Shendure's lab in UW Genome Sciences, which is where he did his PhD.
Before his PhD, Aaron spent almost a decade as a software engineer, first working on an NSA contract and then developing the GATK toolkit at the Broad.
He's headed for a faculty job at Dartmouth now.

Welcome, Aaron, and thanks for participating.
