Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The current theme is branch-specific diversification inference, by which I mean learning about the diversification process via phylogenetics.
If this is macroevolution, then we're talking about speciation and extinction rates, and if this is microevolution, then we're talking about fitness estimation.
Today we will hear from Richard Neher.
If you want to ask a question, you can either tweet @phyloseminar or type your question in the "live chat" box to the right of the video on YouTube.

As I mentioned, today's speaker is Richard Neher.
Richard got his PhD in Physics at LMU Munich advised by Ulrich Gerland, followed by 3 years as a postdoc at KITP at UC Santa Barbara.
He was then a Max-Planck Research Group Leader in TÃ¼bingen, and in 2017 took a position as an Associate Professor at the Biozentrum in the University of Basel.

Richard applies sharp analytical thinking to explain and predict a variety of biological phenomena, from diversification of influenza to HIV reservoirs.
He is now working hard on bacterial evolution, and I'm looking forward to seeing what he comes up with there.

Welcome, Richard, and thanks for participating.
