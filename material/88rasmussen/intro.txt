Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.

The current theme is branch-specific diversification inference, by which I mean learning about the diversification process via phylogenetics.
If this is macroevolution, then we're talking about speciation and extinction rates, and if this is microevolution, then we're talking about fitness estimation.
If you want to ask a question, you can either tweet @phyloseminar or type your question in the "live chat" box to the right of the video on YouTube.

Today's speaker is David Rasmussen.
David develops and applies phylodynamic methods for tracking the spread of pathogens using genomic sequence data.
He did his Ph.D. with Katia Koelle at Duke University and then a postdoc with Tanja Stadler at ETH Zurich.
David joined NC State in Emerging Plant Disease and Global Food Security in January 2018.

Welcome, David, and thanks for participating.
