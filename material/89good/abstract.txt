Most mutations are subject to competitive exclusion, and will either come to dominate a population or go extinct. In special cases, a mutant may evade competitive exclusion by exploiting a different ecological niche. Both types of mutations can be found in large microbial populations, yet little is known about how they combine to determine the genealogical structure of a population. In this talk, I will describe some recent theoretical efforts to address this question, focusing on the dynamics that emerge in simple resource competition models. I’ll show how the competition between ecological diversification and fitness evolution leads to an emergent state of diversification-selection balance, in which semi-stable ecotypes are continuously generated and purged by natural selection. The ecological and genealogical structure of this non-equilibrium steady-state can be characterized analytically in simple asymptotic limits, revealing a crucial dependence on the range of genetically accessible phenotypes. I’ll conclude by discussing potential connections to empirical data, both from laboratory evolution experiments and natural populations of bacteria.
