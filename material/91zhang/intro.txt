Hello everyone, and welcome to phyloseminar.org.
The current theme is variational Bayes phylogenetic inference, and this is talk 2 in a series of 3 talks on that topic.
Please use the YouTube live comment box to ask questions, or tweet @phyloseminar.

Today's speaker is Cheng Zhang.
Cheng got his undergraduate from Peking University, then his PhD from UC Irvine under Hongkai Zhao and Babak Shahbaba, where he worked on scalable Hamiltonian monte carlo algorithms.
He then spent 2.5 years in my group, where he did the work he will talk about today, along with several other interesting and technically difficult projects.
He is now an Assistant Professor in the Department of Probability and Statistics at Peking University.

Welcome, Cheng, and thanks for speaking to us today.
