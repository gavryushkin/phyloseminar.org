Genetic sequencing of pathogens becomes more and more routine during infectious disease outbreaks. If an outbreak has been closely monitored and all (or most) cases have been sampled, these sequences provide the opportunity to infer who infected whom, which may help in identifying the index case, evaluating outbreak control, and characterising risk factors for infectiousness. However, there is no single path from genetic sequences through a phylogenetic tree to a timed transmission tree, describing who infected whom, and when. In this seminar I will explain how this problem is tackled with phybreak, a model and R package. Phybreak has four submodels, for infection, for sampling, for within-host pathogen dynamics, and for mutation, which together describe the relation between a transmission tree and observed genetic variation. Through an MCMC routine the possible phylogenetic and transmission trees are sampled while integrating over the uncertainty created by all submodels simultaneously. I will cover the original submodels and MCMC procedure (doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005495), and show some results obtained with the package. I will finish with some new developments such as multiple samples per host and a wide transmission bottleneck.
