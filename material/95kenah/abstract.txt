Pairwise survival analysis handles dependent happenings in infectious disease transmission data by analyzing failure times in ordered pairs of individuals. The contact interval in the pair ij is the time from the onset of infectiousness in i to infectious contact from i to j, where an infectious contact is sufficient to infect j if he or she is susceptible. The survival function of the contact interval distribution determines transmission probabilities, and its hazard function determines the infectiousness profile of infected individuals. Many important questions in infectious disease epidemiology involve the effects of covariates (e.g., age or vaccination status) on the risk of transmission. Effects on infectiousness and susceptibility can be estimated simultaneously using parametric and semiparametric regression models that account for both person-to-person transmission and infection from external sources. Partial information on who-infected-whom from pathogen genetic sequences can be incorporated into these analyses, which improves precision and reduces bias. Finally, we will discuss how these methods suggest new approaches to the development of epidemiologic methods for infectious diseases.
