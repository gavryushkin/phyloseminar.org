  Once you're logged in, visit our
  <a href="https://plus.google.com/102253747763633136709" rel="publisher">Google+ page</a>
  a few minutes before the scheduled start of the seminar.
  You'll see a post for the live seminar; click the link to join.

  If you'd rather not create a Google/Google+ account, don't worry!
  The seminar will automatically be posted to

  when the seminar is over.
